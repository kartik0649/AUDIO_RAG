Barani Rajakumar: My name is Barani Rajakumar and I'm the CEO and founder of Transfer Inc. Our view is one of the biggest benefits of this technology is providing access. So for the target population that we serve, we refer to them as undiscovered talent. So these are folks that have a lot to offer but perhaps the local employers have not had a chance to interact with them or they don't know what their capabilities are. So when they put on the virtual headset and immerse themselves in the virtual training environment, they get a chance to learn from a digital coach, make mistakes, and learn from their mistakes in real time and then take off the headset and show an employer that they can actually perform those tasks and those duties. And in doing so, it does a couple of things. One is it increases the confidence level of the folks who've gone through the training and also in their ability to kind of like do the job. But it also increases the confidence level of the employer by looking at someone and says, hey, I can see for myself that they can do the job and I feel a lot safer hiring. We think bridging that gap and making that opportunity available is super important because not everybody has an aunt or an uncle or mom and dad that can hook them up with an internship. And so we think that one of the most valuable parts that we can play in the ecosystem is connecting undiscovered talent with employers that are actively looking for talent.
