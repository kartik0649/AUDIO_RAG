  "text": "Industrial Training\nIndustrial Training Solutions\nVR Training Solutions for Industries\nStaffing crisis and slow productivity growth are just two of the many problems faced by companies in traditional industries like skilled trades and automotive which is further complicated by the mass exodus of baby boomer retirements. High employee turnover due to lack of training, burnouts, and low job satisfaction have been a major contributing factor to this problem. Many employers are staring at an increased demand for blue collar workers, but are forced to operate with inadequate resources to keep the lights on.\nTransfr partners with employers in various industries to support their efforts to raise job awareness and attract new talent to the workforce. Transfr VR solutions for industrial training can rapidly train and upskill new hires without high capital investment. Transfr’s immersive training simulations align with industry standards and are equipped with virtual trainers to ensure consistent training delivery. Transfr solutions are a one stop solution for recruitment, skills development, and continuous learning. \nExpand talent pipelines for apprentices and new hires \nRapidly increasing wage rates for new hires, voluntary quits, and lack of interest in blue collar jobs are forcing many companies to operate with inadequate and overstretched resources. Qualified talent is available to hire which also includes opportunity youth, justice involved individuals, and veterans who are ready to make a rewarding career change given proper awareness and training. In light of the acute labor shortages, corporations in blue collar industries will benefit from expanding their recruitment strategies to include awareness campaigns and employee development programs.\nTransfr’s unbiased and non-judgmental VR solutions provide individualized attention to all trainees, and support corporations in attracting quality talent. Transfr creates engaging immersive experiences to raise jobs awareness and develop interest in candidates to join the workforce.\nImplementation of VR training simulations from Transfr develops a safe exposure to the real work environment, which allows companies to develop pre-qualification training programs.\n“Students work in laboratories that mimic work environments for the real world, training to earn industry-standard certifications that can help them enter employment right after high school.”\n– Jennifer Baker, Director of Career and Technical Education at the Center for Advanced Careers\nUpskill and reskill to enhance productivity \nEmployers in skilled trades and other traditional industries face an increased demand for blue collar workers, while staring at a shrinking supply of qualified candidates. Enhancing labor productivity is important for these employers since labor productivity growth has only increased by 0.9% per year on average in the last decade, compared to 2-3% annual increase prior to the Great Recession. Demand for upskilling and reskilling the workforce in critical skills is rising. \nTraining in VR with Transfr is cost effective, safe, offers unlimited practice, and proven to improve retention. Through ourVR training modules, ramp up time for new hires and apprentices can be reduced dramatically. Employers do not have to compromise on production or additional resources to upskill new employees. Transfr solutions are curated by experts and are built to industry standards of NCCER, ASE, and OSHA which allows for stress-free adoption.\n“Hands-on access to VR is a virtue in itself, and it’s been instrumental in getting adult learners closer to their career goals in living-wage industries.”\n– Katherine Maloney, VP of Workforce Development, MoKan Goodwill\nRevamp employee training programs \nAdoption of emerging technologies in employee training programs is a balancing act for employers in traditional industries. Squeezing profits due to high labor turnover, slow productivity growth, and low labor quality add an extra layer of complexity to the company budgeting process. A majority of the employers tend to assign low priority to employee training and revamps to their training programs. This results in a drop in employee morale, reduced job satisfaction, high employee turnover, and high probability of human errors which further complicates the problem.\nTransfr solutions are carefully designed to be implemented as standalone or add-on to existing training programs. Our training simulations are easy to set up requiring just a wi-fi connection, which also alleviates any training setup expenses for employers. All of Transfr’s solutions come equipped with a virtual trainer, who provides continuous guidance and feedback to the employees during the training routine without bias or judgment. Partnership with Transfr ensures adoption of cost-effective immersive training techniques which ensures enhanced training delivery without compromising on quality. \n“I have yet to find a program that provides the wraparound services that we do. The VR component allows someone to really learn the skills and get the repetitions that they need to be able to produce results in the field, making them highly sought after employees.”\nOn-demand virtual trainer offers continuous guidance and interaction with the learner ensuring critical skills development\nWith unlimited practice opportunities in a virtual environment, trainees build confidence without expensing resources\nIndustry standards alignment\nSimulations align to in-demand job requirements and trends to ensure competency based skills development\nSecure and impartial education\nLearning in a non-discriminatory digital setting enables learners of every age and physical capability to learn and train at their individual speed\nTransfr’s VR training solutions for industrial companies are meticulously curated to combat the problems of acute labor shortage, low productivity, and training quality. Industry aligned training simulations from Transfr support rapid upskilling and reskilling of employees and are a perfect enhancement to your existing training programs.\nTeam up with Transfr: Together, we can forge a seamless career transition\nCE 2.0\nAviation"

  "text": "VR Training Solutions for Reentry, Corrections, and Juvenile Justice\nJustice Impacted\nCreating a New Pipeline Out of Incarceration and Into Careers\nTransfr believes in second chances and is a proud supporter of educational and workforce development initiatives focused on youth and adults who have current or previous justice-involvement. Though the purpose of reentry and juvenile programming is to reduce recidivism and rehabilitate, many states still struggle with recidivism rates at or above 40%. This means nearly 1 in 2 will end up repeating the cycle of arrest and incarceration. Youth and adults exiting incarceration or completing at-home monitoring are presented with a mountain of challenges and barriers to successful reentry that take an invested ecosystem to address. \nThrough strategic partnerships, meaningful reentry and juvenile justice initiatives increase access to social supports, mental health and recovery services, housing, education, and workforce development initiatives that train and help connect individuals directly to employment. These initiatives reduce recidivism and save taxpayers millions of dollars. The U.S. Department of Education found that “every dollar invested in prison educational programs saves taxpayers up to five dollars.” Approximately 95% of individuals that have been arrested will return to society. Reentry initiatives acknowledge that the individual who was arrested is more than their mistake — they have hopes and dreams, a family, a purpose. Reentry initiatives also acknowledge that helping these individuals connect with meaningful support and employment make our communities safer, healthier, and wealthier.\nThrough virtual and augmented reality, Transfr is able to offer access to skills training and career navigation for in-demand, well-paid jobs that hire justice-impacted youth and adults both in-facility before release as well as in-community.\nJuvenile Justice partners are utilizing Transfr both in-facility and in-community to\nFoster excitement about learning\nExplore local in-demand, well-paid careers\nUtilize VR as an incentive program to increase positive behaviors\nStreamline youth into CTE-programming at local schools\nConnect youth to local youth-serving nonprofits and mentorship programs\nConnect youth to local hands-on training initiatives\nCreate pathways to healthy adults, jobs, and social supports in-community\nJails, Prisons, and Correctional Industries \nTransfr is partnered with jails, prisons, and CI across the country to provide industry-aligned skills training for in-demand local careers. The success of these initiatives hinges on access to training and education prior to release, pipelines to local employers, and soft hand-offs to community-based partners who can provide mental health, recovery, housing, and other social support. Correctional Industry partners have utilized Transfr to both onboard new employees as well as prepare inmates for reentering the community.\nIn addition to industry-aligned skills training and career exploration, Transfr also offers individuals who are incarcerated the opportunity to \nUtilize and master new technology \nBe immersed in and transported to a different environment without ever leaving the facility\nReceive training without the use of hazardous or sharp materials\nEmpower learners who have not been successful in traditional classroom settings by allowing them to \nPractice skills in privacy with a virtual coach\nUtilize visual, audio, and kinesthetic learning styles simultaneously\nFostering excitement for learning and hope for the future\n“Hands-on access to VR is a virtue in itself, and it’s been instrumental in getting adult learners closer to their career goals in living-wage industries.”\nKatherine Maloney, VP of Workforce Development, MoKan Goodwill\nCommunity-Based Reentry Programming \nTransfr is partnering with nonprofits, probation/parole, community colleges, and workforce development board to create ecosystems and reentry programming across the country focused on engaging returning citizens with the necessary resources and skills to break cycles of recidivism and incarceration.\nBy augmenting in-person training with Transfr’s VR headsets, community-based partners have\nHalved reentry workforce development programming time\nHalved job placement time \nIncreased retention with job placement\nIndividuals have clear idea what the job environment is like \nWhat skills are necessary\nIf they have an aptitude or interest in this type of job/industry\nIncreased access to career exploration and workforce development programming without the added costs of labs, specialized staff, or transportation costs\n“This program is creating 5-star recruits: Teachers are empowered and engaged, students are better qualified and ready for success on day one. “\nDonny Jones, COO West Alabama Works\nSecure and portable training\nVR headsets bring the training directly to trainees, no need to transport trainees to different sites. Headsets will need to be charged and given access to Wifi to work. Headsets are restricted to access only Transfr’s simulations and comply with facility security regulations.\nSafe learning environment \nSafe environment for learners and trainers that bridges gaps in job awareness, training, hiring, and retention. Enables skills practice without exposing trainees to sharp or hazardous materials. \nExplore and train for in-demand, high-paying careers\nBefore careers are added to career exploration and skills training, Transfr researches that these careers are in-demand and are compensated above a living-wage.\nTransfr’s training only requires facilitation, it does not require expertise from the teacher/facilitator. It does not require labs or material costs. It does not require transportation. It does not require any special spaces and can be accomplished in any room with WiFi access. Reducing recidivism with increased employability and access saves taxpayers millions of dollars. In the state of Illinois, each instance of recidivism costs the state of IL $118, 746.\nTransfr VR offers solutions to enhance reentry and juvenile justice programs, foster excitement for learning, increase employability, and decrease recidivism rates\nHow have other facilities secured WiFi for Transfr’s programming? \nTransfr VR simulations and headsets are being used in jails, prisons, and juvenile facilities across the country, but they do require a Wifi connection. Much like the tablets used in many facilities, the headsets are only equipped with the Transfr app and cannot browse the internet, the app store, or any kind of chat.\nLearn more about in-facility solutions\nConstruction\nElectrical Construction\nUpgrade your reentry skills training program with Transfr"

This is critical for bringing opportunity to underserved communities, developing cost-effective training alternatives, and giving employers the trained workforce needed for economic development.\nInnovations Driving Change\n\nWe’ve made incredible strides in forging classroom-to-career pathways over the past year. \nTRIO Electric Partnership: We partnered with TRIO Electric, an electrical design, service, and construction company, to address the growing electrician shortage in the US. TRIO Electric used Transfr’s VR simulations to enhance its training programs and reduce resource consumption. Thanks to Transfr, TRIO has served 292 unique trainees across 11 sites, with a total of 3,674 simulations completed, while also reducing the company’s environmental footprint by minimizing the use of consumable training materials like wire and conduit.\nLaunch of Virtual Healthcare Clinic: Transfr launched a new Virtual Healthcare Clinic with simulations designed to equip learners with the foundational knowledge and skills to prepare them for apprenticeships and jobs in the healthcare industry, which is facing a nationwide shortage of qualified workers. Our innovative approach enables trainees to perform hands-on training with the assistance of a digital coach, all in a fully immersive, 360-degree environment that is entirely risk-free.\nCareer Exploration: In August, we launched an updated VR Career Exploration experience, offering four times as many industries for students to explore which roles and industries fit their interests and skills. Equipped with this understanding, students can then work with counselors and instructors to construct their personal training pathways to a fulfilling professional career in a field with upward mobility and growth potential. \nBGCA Partnership: We’ve also teamed up with the Jim Kelley Career Pathway Center of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Fort Wayne to facilitate career exploration and skills training for juvenile offenders in the Indiana Juvenile Justice System. Leveraging Transfr’s virtual reality technology for simulated training, the program allows students to explore potential career pathways and learn a number of key skills to prepare them to successfully enter the workforce and have a sustainable and fulfilling career upon their re-entry to society. Since partnering with Transfr, BGCA has trained over 750 students at 142 BGCA locations across 28 states, totaling more than 4,440 simulations completed. \n\nFueling Innovation Through Collaboration\nTransfr’s commitment extends beyond our own proprietary solutions. Last year, we launched a software development kit (SDK) that will enable the broader developer and 3D design community to create new training simulations on the Transfr platform and contribute to the future of education.\nOur journey over the past year has been nothing short of remarkable as we’ve relentlessly pursued our mission of bridging the gap between classrooms and careers. From forging impactful partnerships that tackle talent shortages across industries to highlighting a path for justice-impacted youth to enter the workforce, each step has been guided by our unwavering commitment to empowering individuals with the skills they need to succeed.\nToday, Transfr is deployed in over 1,000 locations nationwide, including community colleges, trade schools, employers, prisons, and K-12 schools, and we’ve increased our user base by 10x over the last year alone. Together, we are not only changing lives but also reshaping the landscape of education and workforce development for generations to come."

The prestigious ranking provides a data-driven look at the most successful companies within the economy’s most dynamic segment – its independent, entrepreneurial businesses. Microsoft, Meta, Chobani, Under Armour, Timberland, Oracle, Patagonia, and many other household-name brands gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.\n\n“This high-ranking on the Inc. 5000 is a testament to the movement we’ve created with our incredible team, partners and customers across the country,” says Bharani Rajakumar, founder and CEO of Transfr. “We support communities in achieving economic growth by helping students and adult learners discover, explore and train for careers in local industries where employers are desperate to find skilled workers. There is an enormous need and application for Transfr’s VR technology and comprehensive programs and services, which are transforming the classroom-to-career pathway for more and more Americans every day.”\nThe Inc. 5000 class of 2024 represents companies that have driven rapid revenue growth while navigating inflationary pressure, the rising costs of capital, and seemingly intractable hiring challenges. Among this year’s top 500 companies, the average median three-year revenue growth rate is 1,637 percent. In all, this year’s Inc. 5000 companies have added 874,458 jobs to the economy over the past three years.\nFor complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, location, and other criteria, go to www.inc.com/inc5000. All 5000 companies are featured on Inc.com starting Tuesday, August 13, and the top 500 appear in the new issue of Inc. magazine, available on newsstands beginning Tuesday, August 20.\n“One of the greatest joys of my job is going through the Inc. 5000 list,” says Mike Hofman, who recently joined Inc. as editor-in-chief. “To see all of the intriguing and surprising ways that companies are transforming sectors, from health care and AI to apparel and pet food, is fascinating for me as a journalist and storyteller. Congratulations to this year’s honorees, as well, for growing their businesses fast despite the economic disruption we all faced over the past three years, from supply chain woes to inflation to changes in the workforce.”\nTransfr’s innovative virtual reality (VR) based platform hosts more than 300 simulations that focus on careers in industries that do not require a four-year degree, including Automotive, Aviation, Construction, Diesel, Electrical, Hospitality and Tourism, Manufacturing, and Healthcare. Since the company’s founding in 2017, Transfr has facilitated over 500,000 training simulations and has helped place thousands of people in high-demand jobs. Transfr is deployed in over 1,100 locations nationwide, including community colleges, trade schools, employers, prisons and K-12 schools. In 2023, Transfr secured $40 million in Series C funding led by ABS Capital. The funds are being used to further develop Transfr’s training platform and expand its programs to accommodate its rapidly growing customer base, which more than doubled year over year from 2019-2023.\nMore about Inc. and the Inc. 5000\nMethodology\nCompanies on the 2024 Inc. 5000 are ranked according to percentage revenue growth from 2020 to 2023. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2020.

  "text": "GST Michigan Works! Creates Opportunity with Transfr\nTransfr’s Construction Laborer PEP is a comprehensive 20-hour training program that leverages VR simulations and interactive elearning lessons covering workplace safety, tool recognition, general employability skills, and resume/interview preparation to prepare trainees for construction careers. This hybrid program seamlessly combines immersive VR experiences with interactive tasks and assessments through an elearning platform. The flexibility and portability of the VR technology allowed GST Michigan Works! to deliver training anytime, anywhere — a significant advantage over traditional methods that depend on fixed schedules and classroom settings.\nThroughout the PEP, learners undergo a number of assessments to evaluate knowledge acquisition. Successful completion leads to three micro-credentials (Workplace Safety, Hand Tools, and Power Tools) as well as a certificate of completion. They can present these to prospective employers, educational partners, or future training programs as tangible recognition of their new skills and knowledge.\nThe PEP was deployed as part of GST Michigan Works! Jobs for Michigan’s Graduates programming in partnership with Job Corps. Fessler & Bowman, a local construction company with 60 years of experience in concrete and civil services, and GST Michigan Works! partner, quickly hopped on board and agreed to provide work experience to the youth in the program. Fessler & Bowman is dedicated to workforce development, offering employees opportunities for career advancement and leadership roles.\nThe company’s workforce development division includes innovative training tools, such as a mobile equipment simulator designed to engage new talent in the industry. These initiatives dovetailed perfectly with Transfr’s PEP. Jason Blazen, Career Services Manager, highlighted the importance of the partnership:\n“This technology enables us to introduce career pathways that students might not have considered. It’s less intimidating and more engaging, helping participants build confidence before stepping onto a job site.”"

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we are unable to verify your identity, your authority to make a request on behalf of another person, or if we cannot confirm that the personal information relates to you. In general, we will verify your request and your identity by matching the information you provided with the information we have in our records.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a United States Federal law requiring educational institutions and agencies to adhere to certain practices to protect personally identifiable information of students found in educational records and, to make this information available to parents of those students, or, for students who are 18+ or enrolled in a graduate program, directly to the students themselves. We have prepared this Section to support our customers in the education-sector, with managing their FERPA compliance. \nTransfr only collects Directory Information from educational institutions and agencies. Directory Information is defined under FERPA as personally identifiable information maintained by the educational institution or agency and used to identify a student for administrative purposes. Examples of Directory Information include student names, addresses, and phone numbers. Under FERPA, these records are generally only required to be kept private by the educational institution or agency upon the parent or student’s request, as applicable. \nTransfr takes the following steps to protect personal information covered by FERPA:\n(i) we require educational institutions or agencies from whom we receive student personal information, to confirm compliance with FERPA, including 34 CFR §99.37, in our Terms of Use.\n(ii) we use the information only for the purposes for which it was provided to us (except in instances we are able to de-identify or anonymize student personal information)\n(iii) we promptly respond to requests we receive from educational institutions or agencies with whom we are working, to delete any student personal information from our systems, and \n(iv) we abide by the same practices to safeguard student personal information that we’ve implemented to protect other forms of personal information we collect, as outlined in this Policy.\nChanges to this Policy\nThis Policy is current as of the Last Updated date set forth above.

  "text": "Boys & Girls Club Members Find VR Career Exploration Engaging\nTo better prepare the youth of today for the jobs of tomorrow, VR Career Exploration has to be engaging and informative. When asked about their experiences in Transfr CE simulations, Boys & Girls Club users reported that they felt like they learned a lot and were highly satisfied with their experiences. A majority also responded positively when asked if they would be willing to take training courses with VR simulations.\nTransfr Career Exploration simulations are designed to be short and engaging and give users a quick glimpse into a day in the life of well-paying jobs in high-growth industries. The ability to give explorers access to varied careers — many of which would be very difficult to access via traditional methods like shadowing and field trips — is one of VR’s greatest strengths. Four of the most-completed simulations present situations that would be exceedingly difficult for young learners to experience, but are tied to extremely important jobs in society. Starting young people on these paths early could make a huge difference in shaping the workforce of tomorrow."

  "text": "Transfr Trek and the New World of Work\nThe world of work is changing at an unprecedented pace. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and extended reality (XR) are helping businesses create efficiencies and reskill workers to compete in a new technology-driven environment. To succeed, learners need more than just knowledge — they need the ability to adapt, grow, and continuously discover their potential.\nEvery industry today will be transformed. AI can now write legal briefs, automation runs entire warehouses, and workers train in virtual spaces before touching real equipment. But these technologies aren’t just disrupting jobs — they’re creating new roles that blur traditional career boundaries. A former truck driver might become a fleet logistics programmer, while a retail worker could transition into managing automated checkout systems.\nThe old rules don’t work\nRecent graduates and career changers alike are finding that old career-search strategies no longer guarantee success. An English degree and traditional job search efforts might not compete with AI writing tools. Even a law degree, once considered a safe bet, may not provide the expected return on investment.\nThe World Economic Forum predicts that 50% of workers will need reskilling by 2025, but traditional training methods can’t keep pace. This skills gap presents a growing challenge.\nOpportunity amidst a growing labor shortage\nWhile traditional work is changing, a severe labor shortage is looming in the United States, with economists predicting a 6 million worker deficit by 2032 as population growth outpaces labor force growth by nearly 8 to 1. This shortage is driven by multiple factors:\nAn aging workforce: Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers.\nShifting demographics: Population growth is outpacing labor force growth.\nSkills mismatch: Many job seekers lack the skills needed for in-demand roles.\n\nThese dynamics present a significant opportunity for those who pursue training in fields like healthcare, skilled trades, and essential services. Construction and healthcare, in particular, have numerous openings. These hands-on, difficult-to-automate roles offer increasing job security and earning potential as the labor shortage intensifies.\nTransfr Trek: A new approach to career exploration\nTransfr Trek offers a solution. Instead of generic advice, Transfr Trek provides comprehensive career exploration and interactive work simulations. It democratizes career exploration, making it accessible and engaging for everyone from K-12 students to adults seeking new careers.\nImagine a student exploring manufacturing by troubleshooting a virtual assembly line, or a potential healthcare worker practicing patient intake in VR. Transfr Trek provides this kind of real-world experience before individuals commit to a career path.\nTransfr Trek’s features support learners in all phases of career exploration:\nCareer awareness: Real-time job outlooks, wage data, regional pathways, and personalized career matching.\nCareer experience: Interactive VR simulations offer a “day in the life” perspective on various professions.\nCareer planning: Tools for setting career goals, creating action plans, and tracking progress.\nA modern solution for a dynamic workforce\nTransfr Trek is built around the notion that learning is continuous. It provides tools and frameworks for ongoing career development.\nUnlike traditional education models, Transfr Trek acknowledges that careers are no longer linear; workers may change roles and industries multiple times throughout their lives.\nKey advantages of Transfr Trek:\nConnected, immersive experience: Career exploration that uses interactive assessments, VR simulations, and personalized career matching.\nClassroom-to-career pathway: Support for the entire career development journey\nFocus on non-traditional pathways: Includes skilled trades and apprenticeships, not just college paths\nAffordability and value: A comprehensive solution at a competitive price point\nContinuous improvement and innovation: Ongoing research and development ensures Transfr Trek remains at the forefront of career exploration technology.\nBuilding a stronger workforce and communities\nTransfr Trek is more than a technology product — it’s a tool for lifelong learning and workforce equity. By partnering with schools, nonprofits, and community organizations, Transfr aims to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to explore fulfilling careers and achieve upward economic mobility.\nAs we look to the future, solutions like Transfr Trek remind us that education and career development are not endpoints but evolving journeys. By empowering individuals to secure in-demand jobs and provide for themselves and their families, you’re not just creating a brighter future for them; you’re building a stronger and more vibrant community that can provide new opportunities for economic growth to future generations.\nWe’re thrilled to partner with you in this mission.\nDiscover how Transfr is reshaping career exploration."

  "text": "How TRIO Electric Scales Workforce Training with Transfr's VR Learning\nElectricity runs everything around us. It’s one of the most vital forces in our modern world and everything that moves needs it — and that could all go away. Not tomorrow, not all at once, but the people who keep the infrastructure you and the entire world depend on running are disappearing. Retirement is the main cause, but a lack of interest in the trades overall has contributed to a rise in open electrician jobs across the country. \nNo one knows this better than TRIO Electric. For almost 20 years, they’ve been serving their customers, employees, and community, wiring up commercial and industrial building projects of all kinds — schools, hospitals, and more. But like the electrical construction industry as a whole, TRIO is staring down a hiring crisis.\n“In order to grow, we need electricians,” says Beau Pollock, TRIO’s CEO. “And I can’t find them. So, one of the ways we serve the community is by offering vocational training to both high school students who most likely won’t go to college, and for adults who are looking for reskilling or upskilling that will lead to a better career.”\nThis is a bold move on TRIO’s part, not just bringing on green electrician apprentices, but developing an in-house electrician’s apprentice program that equips new recruits with the skills they’ll need to be effective on a job site from day one. While it helps solve their hiring problem, this very successful program creates challenges that have no easy solutions.\nFor starters, every class needs an instructor, and there are only so many electricians in any area with the skills necessary to train others. Equally important, an experienced electrician needs to have the right attitude, mindset, and skills to teach others — that’s where many training programs run into challenges as well:\n“Great electricians don’t always make great instructors,” says Beau. “Plus, most seasoned electricians aren’t willing to leave the work environment to teach; they’d rather be out on the job.”\nFaced with these challenges, TRIO’s training program seemed doomed to limitations it couldn’t overcome with the resources at its disposal — then Beau met Transfr CEO Bharani Rajakumar.\nLearn more about the VR electrical construction simulations — built with TRIO!\nBeau and the TRIO team had been exploring VR as a training add-on for some time before Beau met Bharani. In fact, many of their training modules had been turned into e-learning modules with video content to help amplify the effectiveness of human instructors and deliver content in a consistent manner. VR would take that to the next level. \n“I had interviewed several different virtual reality firms and was impressed with Transfr’s user interface.” Beau recounts. “But ultimately, it came down to a simple test: I let my kid try on a bunch of the VR headsets I’d been sent. Within a few minutes on the Transfr headset, he was changing the oil on a car using the oil change simulation. I knew if he could handle it, it could work for many adults.”\nHands-on simulations using Transfr would allow TRIO to reach more students with the same facilities and instructors they already had. The key would be bolstering their already-stellar curriculum with VR simulations. \n“What sets TRIO apart is that our curriculum is designed for industry, by industry,” explains Sam Chiarella, Curriculum Development Lead at TRIO. “We outlined the best practices for the most tasks that are done in the field and combined them with what we knew we needed from safe and productive electricians, which became e-learning modules for our training program. We extracted some of the most important lessons and those became the basis for the Transfr simulations.”\nThis was a lengthy and detailed process facilitated by curriculum leads at TRIO and subject matter experts (SMEs) and instructional designers at Transfr. (Hear their stories on Upward, the Transfr Podcast.) The tasks needed to be analyzed and broken down into their smallest components, with a focus on which skills could be taught virtually, without holding the actual physical tools or using real world materials — while still effectively building muscle memory in learners.\n“The pressure was on when I first was asked to work on this project, because it’s dealing with something that’s traditionally taught with physical, hands-on materials that they are actually touching,” says Justin Thompson, Instructional Designer at TRIO. “We began with task analysis documents from Transfr. We had to make sure that the way the simulations were being taught mapped to how electricians actually perform the work in the field.”\nThe sim creation process was extremely collaborative, with a lot of back and forth between Transfr and TRIO to build the highest-quality simulations. The result is a package of simulations that students and instructors are excited about. \n“Having simulations built with input from many SMEs [Subject Matter Experts] makes everything better,” says Edgar Anguilu, an instructor at TRIO. “Because you’ve got different people bringing in their perspectives and experiences.”\nUsing simulated training for a trade as hands-on as electrical construction might seem counterintuitive, but the simulations have been a big hit with both instructors and students. Instructors at TRIO get to empower students with more repetitions of core skills without having to split their attention between multiple groups of students. Students get the ability to progress through content as quickly as they wish, reviewing skills and relying on Transfr’s AI coach to help them master essential techniques they’ll use on job sites.\n“The VR simulations teach the students how to follow vital processes from beginning to end,” says Andrea Calvo, Education Program Director at TRIO. “They learn the names of every tool they’ll be using, how to handle them, the various materials, and safety measures.”\nMeanwhile, at nearby Alief Independent School District’s Center for Advanced Careers, high school students are immersed in the same program TRIO’s adult learners experience in a state-of-the-art career and technical education center. The “classrooms” at this sterling facility are modeled after the job sites students will encounter in the real world, with an eye towards helping students enter the workforce after high school.\n“Students work in laboratories that mimic work environments for the real world, training to earn industry-standard certifications that can help them enter employment right after high school,” explains Jennifer Baker, Director of Career and Technical Education at the Center for Advanced Careers, explains. “In 2019, TRIO approached me and offered to provide the curriculum, help train the students, with the possibility of hiring them right out of high school. This was my dream! And now we’ve enhanced the classroom experience with the VR headsets.”\nStudents from TRIO’s training program and other locations are excited about the opportunities that VR simulations provide: Proceeding at their own pace, performing unlimited repetitions of key skills, as well as the chance to practice without their classmates’ eyes on them the whole time.\n“You get to track your own knowledge,” says student Lauren Tanner. “It felt good getting a gold medal at the end of the course and moving on to the next lesson!” \nThe ability to work independently also paid off huge for TRIO apprentice Michael Cox, who was able to jump into the simulations and complete them and the TRIO VR electrical construction training program at an accelerated pace, speeding his time from green recruit to paid, working electrician’s apprentice.\n“The VR training was very effective for me, personally,” Michael says. “It was very informative and precise and got into really good detail as well — not just in terms of the physical side of seeing what you’ll be doing, but also the underlying knowledge you need in the field.”\nTraining for almost every skilled trade carries with it some degree of risk: Sharp and heavy tools, heat and fire, and — for electrical construction, of course — electricity. Now, while electrician training programs across the generations have successfully managed to teach necessary skills safely, knowing that you’re training in a VR environment with zero risk of injury can go a long way towards setting a student’s mind at ease when beginning their EC journey."

  "text": "NCCER & Transfr VR Training Pilot Demonstrates Measurable Student Improvement\nThe VR group did better than the traditional group on both evaluations: The average test score from the Traditional group was lower (Mean =13.46; Standard Error = 1.96) than the VR group (M = 17.67; SE = 1.45). The average NCCER assessment score from the Traditional group was lower (M = 53.46, SE = 10.88) than the VR group (M = 75, SE = 5.16). 100% of students who chose the VR option completed the NCCER evaluation and succeeded in securing jobs post-training, vs a completion and job-placement rate of 69% for the non-VR control group.\nThe ABC Illinois and NCCER study drives home the added level of task understanding that students can achieve when training with hands-on VR simulations like Transfr’s, accompanied by real-world instruction from a trainer. For many of the skilled trades (construction, welding, electrical), VR gives students a safer initial exposure to the skills they need to learn. They can also practice unlimited times in a consequence-free environment, without the need to use up costly consumables like wire, wood, and metal.\nImproved outcomes are an important factor when considering adding VR training to a conventional program, but students in the ABC Illinois-NCCER study also reported increased interest in the content and engagement with subject matter. Intangibles like this contribute to a more robust student experience and can help drive increased participation in the trades in a variety of settings!"

  "text": "Customer Story - AmSkills Mobile VR Career Exploration\nExecutive Summary\nMobility can be a big challenge for job seekers everywhere. In the Tampa Bay area, AmSkills solves this problem by bringing mobile career boot camp programs right to the communities that need help most. Instructors provide career counseling, soft skills training, augmented by Transfr simulations, and hands-on real-world projects to help job seekers choose career paths, build skills, and prepare them for employment in local high-growth industries like manufacturing. Transfr’s simulations enhance these boot camps by providing experiences that could not be replicated in the field without buying and transporting expensive and unwieldy equipment. Learners were highly engaged and reacted positively to the Transfr training experience.\nAmSkills strives to meet job-seekers where they live\nWhen serving students and job seekers, it’s important to meet them where they are. This often takes the form of tailored counseling and support services. AmSkills takes this idea literally with their mobile Career Discovery Bootcamps. Transportation is a big hurdle for many job seekers due to cost and limited vehicle ownership, especially for those in marginalized communities and places with few or no low-cost public transit options.\nAmSkills’ solution is to bring mobile boot camps right where their audiences live. Candidates participate in a two-week, hands-on, highly interactive program where instructors meet with local job seekers at community centers, schools and at local manufacturing facilities, leading sessions on soft skills and interviewing, with an eye towards connecting them with local employers, especially in Tampa’s resurging manufacturing sector. \nThe challenge: Making these mobile boot camps as engaging and valuable as possible for attendees. \nAmSkills augments in-person programs with Transfr\nAdding career exploration and skills training with Transfr to their bootcamps was a game-changer for Tom and the AmSkills team. They use the compact, portable, easy-to-use headsets to give job seekers access to a wide range of career options and skills, without the need for specialized facilities or lugging around expensive (and breakable) equipment.\n“The Transfr VR system allows you to work with sometimes dangerous equipment in a safe setting, says Tom. “We don’t have to bring in a thousand-dollar piece of equipment or risk people damaging a million-dollar piece of equipment because they can do it virtually.”\nBootcamp attendees can delve into careers they might never have considered, then master some basic skills so that they’ll step onto their future job sites with the basic knowledge of what will be expected of them. Local companies can interview and hire graduates with confidence, knowing exactly what skills and techniques they’ll have learned in the hands-on simulations.\nUsing Transfr is a win-win for local job seekers, the dedicated professionals at AmSkills, and local employers. \nAmSkills Career Discovery Bootcamps in action\nTampa’s manufacturing industry is coming back, and the AmSkills team, augmented by Transfr technology, is right there to build a pipeline of skilled, qualified applicants for local employers while helping job seekers create their own unique pathways to prosperity. They know that there’s not a one-size-fits-all formula for workforce development success — and with Transfr’s career exploration and skills modules plus the human adaptability of the AmSkills staff, they have the ability to customize the experience of every job seeker they serve. \nThe hands-on simulations, facilitated by VR technology, are only a small part of the world-changing work that AmSkills and Transfr are doing, but for some learners, especially younger ones, they can be a huge draw that gets them excited about career exploration, learning new skills, and building a solid plan to get to a better future. Here’s Tom Mudano again:\n“We have programs in high schools as well. We are putting Transfr in the classrooms. We’re seeing students hurrying to finish their work so they can get on the VR system. It’s a great incentive for them. Today’s youth grew up on video games… being able to reach them through a different platform that they’re used to is great.”\nOne AmSkills student had this to say: “In virtual reality, the thing I liked the most was the one-on-one attention. It felt like they were right there next to me.”\nBetween the draw of innovative technology and the one-on-one experience (inside Transfr and in the “real world”), the AmSkills-Transfr combo is a huge draw that delivers huge value for a diverse audience. \nAmSkills and Transfr — Creating Pathways to Better Jobs\nThe pathway from classroom or mobile bootcamp to a well-paying job can be a long one, but every step along the way matters, as does every unique individual that AmSkills and Transfr helps. AmSkills has helped dozens of job seekers find and keep jobs, in high-growth industries, doing work they can be proud of. \n“We’ve helped homeless moms, we’ve helped high school kids who didn’t have any idea what they wanted to do with their lives and helped them get into careers they had never considered,” Tom says. \nThe future is bright for Tampa’s manufacturing sector and the industrious locals working those jobs, with the help of the dedicated team at AmSkills. Transfr is excited to train the future workers of every industry through programs like AmSkills, as their teams go out day after day to help people find their own ways into well-paying jobs. Hands-on VR manufacturing simulations, plus the human touch and a robust suite of career skills is a winning combination for AmSkills, Tampa, and the future of Florida."

  "text": "Empowering Careers with Local Workforce Board Support\nIn today’s rapidly evolving job market, the demand for skilled workers has never been higher. Workforce Development Boards (WDBs) play a critical role in ensuring job seekers have the training they need to meet employer demands. According to Dana Hudgins, Associate Director at the Upstate Workforce Board in South Carolina, technology is at the heart of this transformation. “We are trying our best to make sure we’re using advanced tools to connect with our clients.”\nWDBs are instrumental in strengthening local economies by providing upskilling and reskilling opportunities. “We’re the recipient of WIOA Funding Title One, and we work to fund our programs to ensure that we’re meeting employer needs at the local level,” Hudgins explains. “It is so important that we listen to our employers and hear their needs to ensure that we are upskilling our job seekers to keep pace with those needs,” However, scaling effective training programs presents challenges, such as long waitlists at community colleges, financial constraints for job seekers, and the preference for more rapid training over long-term programs.\nOne of the biggest hurdles for workforce development programs is accessibility. Many job seekers face geographical and financial constraints that limit their ability to participate in traditional training. Virtual reality (VR) training simulations, like those offered by Transfr, provide an innovative solution. “Being able to use VR technology gives us an opportunity to engage with our customers in a safe and fun environment. It cuts down on the cost of travel, it cuts down on the cost of expensive equipment, and really gives them a comfortable and effective learning environment to confidently develop skills,” Hudgins says."

  "text": "5 Tips for Making Virtual Reality Job Shadowing a Success\nVirtual job shadowing is being revolutionized by the emergence of virtual reality by allowing students and job seekers to enter immersive, simulated workplaces and experience a “day in the life” of various careers from anywhere. This innovation allows participants to explore industries and jobs via VR, making immersive job exploration more accessible, engaging, and effective.\nRead on for actionable advice for career fairs that can help you make the most of VR career exploration simulations, maximizing learning and engagement.\nWhy virtual job shadowing is gaining popularity\nVirtual job shadowing offers a realistic glimpse into careers without the logistical hurdles of traditional job shadowing. It provides participants with the opportunity to observe tasks, workflows, and skills in action from a classroom or other central location.\nSo, how does a virtual career fair work in the context of job shadowing? One of the best models is to create a hybrid experience where learners don VR headsets and interact with lifelike simulations of workplaces and reflect on those experiences via other classroom activities. Virtual career exploration eliminates the need for physical travel and can accommodate a wide array of learning styles, making it a sought-after career exploration tool.\n“How is someone going to come talk to students about the programs they offer and have them make a decision without ever experiencing the job?” asks Cody Waits, Director of the Arkansas Office of Skills Development. “ One of my first thoughts when I saw Transfr was ‘What a great opportunity to engage students differently!’ Now they can explore a broad swath of occupations.”\nAdvantages of virtual career exploration\nRealistic VR simulations allow participants to experience lifelike environments where they can explore industries and roles interactively and really get a feel for what working there would be like. VR career exploration also helps overcome accessibility barriers like geographical distance or physical limitations, democratizing career exploration opportunities. \nWhile traditional job shadowing often involves travel and logistical expenses, VR provides a budget-friendly alternative. VR is also safer than going on-site to workplaces, allowing learners to practice skills (even potentially dangerous ones) without real-world consequences, fostering confidence in a controlled setting. Think of virtual job shadowing as kind of a virtual career fair, but with immersive learning experiences that let participants try on careers without leaving the classroom. Here are five specific tips that can help you deliver a stellar virtual career fair:\n#1: Choose high-quality VR career exploration simulations\nThe more lifelike the VR simulation, the better the learning experience. Choose modules built on deep industry experience and with knowledgeable digital guides or coaches.\n“Having simulations built with input from many subject matter experts makes everything better,” says Edgar Anguilu, an instructor at TRIO Electric in Houston, TX. “Because you’ve got different people bringing in their perspectives and experiences.”\n#2: Prepare participants for the VR experience\nSet clear expectations. Before sending participants into a VR simulation, clarify its purpose and potential outcomes. Provide participants with a preview of what they’ll experience so they can approach the session with focus and curiosity.\nMake sure participants are familiar with the VR headset hardware and controls. Offering practice sessions before the live job shadow can help reduce learning curves and maximize time spent engaging with the module.\n#3: Make the experience interactive and reflective\nDrive engagement by encouraging active exploration within the VR environment. Use guided prompts or challenges to keep participants on task and deepen their understanding.\nFollow-up simulation time with discussion prompts to help participants process what they learned. Reflection can connect the experience to their broader career interests and aspirations.\n#4: Integrate supplementary resources\nEnhance VR sessions with additional materials like industry reports, career advice videos, or live Q&A sessions with professionals (on-site or via video calls, etc.).\nVR job shadowing makes a great addition to a broader curriculum. For example, simulation time can be paired with career aptitude tests, resume-building workshops, and other activities to provide a well-rounded virtual career exploration experience.\n#5: Collect feedback to improve the experience\nFeedback from participants can reveal gaps in VR simulations and areas that need improvement.\nAny VR dedicated developer likely works tirelessly to refine its simulations, based on user input. Regularly updating the content ensures it reflects current industry trends, keeping the experience relevant and impactful. Feedback from users in the field can help make future simulations even better.\nConclusion: Five ways to make virtual job shadowing a success\nTo recap, here are the key tips for making VR job shadowing effective:\nChoose high-quality modules tailored to career goals.\nPrepare participants by setting expectations and ensuring technical readiness.\nFoster interactivity and reflection during and after the session.\nIntegrate supplementary resources to enrich the learning experience.\nLeverage feedback to refine and improve the modules.\nThe future of career exploration\nVirtual job shadowing is a game-changer in making career insights and training more accessible to all. As organizations adopt VR technology, participants will gain unparalleled access to career exploration opportunities. With all the technological advances changing the face of education, you may be asking: “Do career fairs actually help?”\nThe answer is that today’s students and job seekers need a wide array of opportunities and experiences to find their pathways to the careers of tomorrow. Tools like Transfr Trek, which offers a mobile experience designed to help with career pathing, are redefining how people connect with their dream professions. Career Development Coordinator Diana Ollis at Union County Public Schools in North Carolina, leaves us with this about the power of VR with their School System:\n“Transfr allows students to explore lots of different occupations to get them to think outside of the box. Students need to realize that there are lots of opportunities out there, not just what you see in the community at home.”"

In the act-out condition, participants overestimated time spent by more than 90 seconds, but underestimated time spent in the VR simulation by more than two and half minutes. This difference was statistically significant* and suggests training time in VR flies by faster than in the real world. This may have positive implications for widespread VR training adoption, especially when combined with other positive engagement ratings (see next section).\nAs many educators can attest, learner engagement is one of the most important elements of delivering any educational content. After both VR and real-world practice, participants rated how much they enjoyed and felt engaged by the practice, as well as how enthusiastic they were to learn other skills using the same form of practice. All ratings were on a 1-7 scale with higher numbers indicating more enjoyment, engagement, and enthusiasm.

Past efficacy studies conducted by the Transfr team have focused on the learning gain from a single exposure to VR training content (compared to another training method: Written content, video, etc.).\nThe current study was designed to evaluate how many times a group of trainees needed to repeat a VR simulation (the “Stocks” Culinary simulation) before they reached a benchmark score (also referred to as “training to criterion”). This number was compared to the number of times a separate group of trainees had to act out the steps in making stocks using real cooking equipment and following a written set of instructions (the “act-out” condition).\nIn this study, 19 participants (9 VR, 10 act-out) repeated their respective training method until they achieved 90% accuracy on a real-world test.

  "text": "Learning Experts Weigh in on VR Training\nLearning Experts Weigh in on VR Training in Interactive Panel\nJack Cieslak \nOctober 1, 2024 \nShare this story\nTransfr was very excited to host four learning experts, seasoned PhDs with decades in the field of education and learning science, for an in-depth discussion on VR training and the future of learning. The first session of the Transfr Film Festival webinar series — “Can VR Advance Learning?” — was a compelling, interactive panel discussion among Drs. Yun Jin Rho (VP of Learning Intelligence, Transfr), Keith Lyle (Director of Learning Sciences, Transfr), Pooja Agarwal (cognitive scientist, Berklee School of Music Professor, and author), and OP McCubbins (associate professor of Agricultural Education at Mississippi State University).\nAfter screening a short film that the Transfr Video Team had compiled from an on-site visit to our Louisville, KY — featuring Drs. Rho and Lyle, as well as research assistant Alicia Pennywell and several study participants — the panel dove into some key findings from the video, discussed the unique ways that VR can help people learn, and shared their thoughts on how VR can help prepare, the current generation of students and job seekers for the careers of the future.\nKey video takeaways: VR is highly effective and engaging\nWhile training with Transfr sims takes place in the virtual world, measuring the effectiveness of those simulations takes place in the real world. The Learning Intelligence Team conducts field research and surveys in various locations and operates a research lab in Louisville, KY. Our Video Team went on-site to capture video with actual test participants (Drs. Rho and Lyle) for a compelling video about this industry-leading research.\nConversations with participants surfaced their genuine thoughts about learning via VR—interviews with Drs. Rho and Lyle (as well as Research Assistant Alicia Pennywell) revealed their findings, including a documented increase in “A” grades when VR was integrated into college automotive classes. Learners who used Transfr’s Virtual Health Clinic simulations to learn vital healthcare tasks showed significant learning gains, regardless of demographic background.\n“We found that learning from VR simulations had more positive outcomes than the traditional learning methods,” Dr. Rho explains. “These learning gains didn’t just apply to one group of students or a certain group of students, but to all different types of novice learners.”\nExperts sound off on the value of VR practice\nWhile a host of factors potentially contribute to VR’s effectiveness (immersion, lack of distractions, similarity with real-world scenarios), one aspect of VR learning that the panel spent considerable time discussing was active learning and repeated practice. In a VR learning simulation, users begin familiarizing themselves with the tools and processes immediately and can make mistakes in a safe, consequence-free environment.\n“I think [the findings from the Learning Intelligence Team] tell us that immersive learning works,” said Dr. McCubbins. “Hands-on learning experiences work; it doesn’t have to be a real-world experience. It can be a simulated experience. I think that there’s lots of benefits to being able to offer some of those simulated experiences.”\nDr. McCubbins asserts that even simulated experiences can have value when helping people acquire new skills, and the ability for learners to get plentiful practice repetitions in a safe, consequence-free environment may contribute to VR’s effectiveness. Dr. Agarwal, author of Powerful Teaching, had this to add about the importance of “retrieval practice” in developing new skills:\n“Retrieval practice is simply practicing what we know…” Dr. Agarwal explains. “When we practice an instrument, we learn it better. When we practice a language, we learn it better. And so something neat about VR, especially now, is the element of practice built in. That is what VR serves the purpose for, is retrieval practice. I’ve looked at several EdTech tools. We’ve all seen many of them come and go over the years and the decades. And VR seems like a fantastic opportunity to encourage more of that practice in real-time.”\nVR offers exciting new horizons for learning\nSince the dawn of the species, humans have gathered — and, more importantly, shared — knowledge. Technological advances like writing, digital storage, and the internet represent developments and variations in how we preserve, collect, and disseminate that knowledge. VR training is another link in this chain of learning techniques with unique possible benefits. VR can help increase access to learning opportunities for students and job seekers in various settings.\n“One thing that we’ve also talked about is learning to generalize what you learn in the headset to various settings,” Dr. Lyle explains. “This is an age-old problem in learning and education… often educators only have the opportunity to teach in one particular setting, even though they know that learners will need to be able to fix a variety of different cars, not just one. VR has the potential for us to vary the parameters much more readily than can often be varied in current educational situations.”\nDr. Agarwal left us with her take on the broad applicability of VR learning and its potential to change the way we learn:\n“What excites me about VR learning research is its generalizability… from automotive learning to recipe learning, to health sciences… I haven’t seen previous [learning] tools that have this element of improving learning in a lot of different domains… I’m excited about what long-term learning in VR might look like.”\nWant more information about the effectiveness of VR learning?\nJack Cieslak \nJack Cieslak is the Editorial Director at Transfr. He’s worked in tech for over a decade, writing for Amazon, CB Insights, and Sisense, among others. When he’s not behind a computer, he enjoys martial arts, gardening, hiking, and of course, reading.

  "text": "Is VR Training Effective? | Transfr\nVirtual reality (VR) training can be highly effective at delivering skills training in realistic, simulated environments for a variety of hands-on occupations in industries like manufacturing, automotive, electrical construction, aviation maintenance, healthcare and more. That being said, introducing virtual reality as a student learning option can raise questions regarding its effectiveness when supplementing hands-on learning in the skilled trades. \n\nVR training has been shown to be effective at teaching individuals new skills, but it’s also a great tool to engage students and hold their attention in a way that traditional learning environments have a harder time achieving. VR simulations can give individuals a fun and engaging way to explore different industries and learn the skills necessary to break into those career paths.\nIn 2022, the National Center for Construction Education and Research (NCCER) along with the Associated Builders and Contractors of Illinois (ABC Illinois) conducted a pilot study to evaluate potential improvements in training outcomes and engagement when introducing VR simulations to the class content. \n\nTwo classes performed two assigned NCCER tasks — circular saw and electric drill training. One class was set in a traditional lab, while the other class incorporated VR learning. Both classes included instruction, instructor demonstration, and the opportunity to demonstrate mastery during guided practice. An expert evaluator assessed each learner’s performance using the same rubric.\nThe pilot study showed that incorporating VR skills training was effective, with students in the VR class actually performing better than the students who were in the traditional lab, boasting assessment scores of 75% vs 53.46%. Additionally, 100% of the VR class secured employment following training, as opposed to 69% for the non-VR class. \nVR training boosts confidence\nStudents often struggle to stay engaged and present in traditional classroom settings. Finding new ways to get students excited about what they’re learning is a constant challenge for instructors.\n\nIn 2023, Transfr partnered with Arkansas State University (ASU) Three Rivers Career Center to measure student experiences with VR learning by analyzing survey data. The survey gathered information about students’ comfort level with VR, engagement, and confidence levels using simulations. Results of the Arkansas Efficacy Study were positive overall, with 67% of students reporting that their confidence in learning had positively changed since using the VR simulations and 71% reporting a positive change in perceived learning. \nVR training is engaging\nFollowing their participation in VR training, students in the ABC Illinois/NCCER pilot study reported increased interest and engagement with the subject matter.\n\n“It was really fun using VR.” says one student. “It gives you real world scenarios on how to use power tools. I’m not just going [into the workforce] not knowing how to use the tool.” \n\n“VR training is different!” reports another student. “It’s really cool to learn about tools and safety and to get to apply those lessons in VR and [to be able to gain] a real idea of what to expect on the job.” \n\nBringing an exciting and engaging technology to the classroom can help unlock interests and competencies that might have otherwise never been brought to the surface. This sort of engagement was especially notable for John Bratton, an instructor at ASU Three Rivers:\n\n“It’s great to see how well students responded to the VR headsets, how quickly they adapted and how engaged they were with the simulations.” says Bratton. “The students put their phones down, focused on the training simulation, and were able to complete the modules without distraction.”\nVR training augments instructors\nAnother benefit of VR comes in the form of AI coaches who are able to provide personalized instruction. This can free up classroom instructors to devote more time to work one-on-one with students in the lab. Digital coaches are armed with subject matter expertise derived from humans with decades in their fields, as well as unlimited patience. Students can learn at their own pace in a supportive and safe environment free from outside distractions and can help reduce the impacts of biases based on gender, race, or other differences.\n\nTransfr’s AI instructors can also help augment instructors not only by supporting existing programs, but can also provide the resources necessary to start entire new programs! Imagine trying to launch an aviation maintenance program from the ground up: Not only would you need airplanes, specialized equipment, and massive hangers to store it all. With VR aviation maintenance simulations, much of the course curriculum could take place in a virtual environment, with in-person instructors leading the way and providing additional context and individualized attention in the laboratory setting.\nGiving students a better future with VR skills training\nTechnology’s advance can be hard to keep up with, but it is something educators are tasked with to stay relevant. By incorporating new and exciting technologies in the classroom, instructors can increase student retention and comprehension, as well as satisfaction in their learning. Instructors can also benefit by being able to share the responsibility of delivering content and having more 1:1 time with their students.\n\n“Transfr is a great company to work with and the technology that they have developed creates stimulating real-world experiences for students.” says Shelton State Ready to Work instructor Molly Wagner. “We’re leveraging this cutting-edge technology to try to create excitement for career exploration in prospective students.”\nWant to read more stories of how VR training is effective with Transfr?"

  "text": "Challenges to Triumph: Jordan's Journey with Goodwill\nAt Transfr, we believe in the power of education and training to transform lives. To help make this happen, we partner with a variety of schools, workforce boards, and community organizations to bring training and employment opportunities to people from all walks of life. With the right training and community support, it’s our belief that everyone can find their own path to a well-paying job in a high-growth industry.\nOur most recent example of finding a pathway to upward mobility through education comes to us in the form of a young man named Jordan Draughn and his extraordinary story. Born and raised in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Jordan faced the kind of struggles that many young people endure, with the odds seemingly stacked against them. With five siblings and only one working parent, stability was a luxury they couldn’t afford. Like many in his situation, Jordan started working at age 16 to support himself, putting school on the back burner in favor of earning a paycheck.\nBy his senior year, Jordan was working 40 hours a week. Despite his hard work, the feeling of success eluded him as he watched his classmates graduate and move on with their lives.\n“Maybe I’m not as accomplished as I thought I was,” Jordan shares, reflecting on his situation at the time.\nHe moved from one minimum wage job to another — at gas stations, supermarkets, dishwashing — but he never found the sense of direction that he craved. Eventually, Jordan ended up couch surfing, his whole life packed into a single tote bag, feeling adrift.\nIt was during this time of uncertainty that Jordan’s mother encouraged him to explore the training programs offered by Goodwill-Easter Seals Minnesota (GESMN). While Jordan initially had reservations, he also realized that he had nothing to lose. The decision to enter the program changed his life.\nThe GESMN difference: Support, resources, and empowerment\nA key differentiator of the GESMN program is the hands-on, human-centric approach that the team takes to developing people. This approach is best accomplished by professionals who have walked in the shoes of those they serve. One such exceptional champion is Roxanne Lorine. Roxanne is the workforce manager at GESMN who worked closely with Jordan and recalls his journey vividly:\n“Jordan had a lot on his plate when he first came to us,” says Roxanne. “But what sets Goodwill apart is our ability to offer resources and a robust curriculum in a short amount of time. We focus on providing individuals like Jordan with the tools they need to succeed quickly, because for many, postsecondary education takes too long.”\nThe GESMN program offered Jordan essential support — helping him secure food assistance, transportation, and even a laptop to continue his studies. This combination of elements gave Jordan some quick wins and helped him build up some self-confidence. Within weeks of joining the workforce development program, he earned a GED and the boost in self-esteem that came with it.\n“Jordan was determined to succeed, but like many students, he needed more than just technical training,” Roxanne explains. “He needed the confidence to believe in himself and the belief that a brighter future was within reach.”\nThe GESMN program’s holistic approach made all the difference, providing both emotional and practical support to help Jordan regain his footing. Importantly, GESMN’s approach is to help individuals when they are ready for that help — which is critical. Jordan has been in and out of GESMN programs in prior years, but this time something clicked. He was a young adult with high school in the rear view mirror; it was time to turn the page and move forward.\nJordan enrolled in the GESMN automotive program, which integrated Transfr’s virtual reality (VR) training modules. What he thought would be a simple course on tire changing and basic car maintenance turned out to be a comprehensive, immersive experience. VR allowed him to learn in virtual environments that closely simulated real-world conditions, without the fear of making mistakes on real cars.\n“The first time you put the VR headset on, you feel like you’re in a new place, a new world,” says Jordan. “It’s a really good experience to have.”\nEmpowering learners with VR\nThrough the VR elements of the program, Jordan not only learned technical skills but also gained the confidence he needed to pursue his dreams.\n“VR gave Jordan the ability to practice in a safe environment without fear of failure,” Roxanne explains. “It’s not just about learning how to change a tire; it’s about empowering our students to step into real-world roles with confidence. Virtual reality allowed Jordan to understand the steps before working on a car, making him more focused and prepared when he actually did the work.”\nThe immersive nature of VR training gave Jordan the practical knowledge he needed to walk into the shop and feel ready to tackle tasks like lifting cars, changing tires, and performing oil changes — all skills that helped him land a job at Firestone.\nTowards brighter future: Building a career and a family\nBut Jordan’s story doesn’t stop with securing a job. Today, he’s studying to become a Master Technician at Saint Paul College, steadily earning certifications and deepening his expertise. From being homeless and uncertain of his future, Jordan now has his own place he can call home, professional stability, and the ability to support his growing family.\n“I have a 3 month old son now!” Jordan shared with pride. “And because of the skills I learned at Goodwill, I can take care of him now and give him the opportunities that I didn’t have.\n“Jordan’s success is a testament to what happens when you invest in people and give them the chance to grow,” Roxanne adds. “We’re proud of what he’s accomplished and excited to see him continue to thrive.”\nAt Transfr, we’re committed to creating career opportunities for everyone, and through partnerships like the one with Goodwill-Easter Seals Minnesota, we’re making that vision a reality. We are not just training people for jobs; we’re helping them build lives they can be proud of.\nWant to hear more Transfr success stories?"

  "text": "Driving Informed Choices with VR Career Exploration\nIt takes a variety of tactics to help students and job seekers of all kinds find the right career path and figure out how to access the training and support that they will need to make their dreams into reality. Transfr partners across the USA are integrating VR into their career search and work-readiness programs to help people get deeper insights into what the requirements and pathways are like for different jobs.\nRyan Ott, Executive Director of Big Ideas (a nonprofit in Minnesota focused on raising awareness of trade jobs) and Transfr’s own Amanda Longtain (Director of Economic Development), joined us on Upward, the Transfr podcast to discuss the ways VR is being used in the field to help students explore job possibilities and start on their pathways to career success.\nEngaging students with VR\nVR is engaging — full stop. Don’t just take our word for it; check out our collection of in-depth VR efficacy studies to see how our world-class research team is collecting insights into VR effectiveness. Immersive VR experiences help students and job seekers get realistic insights into what a day in the life of a given professional would be like. Ryan and his team leverage VR simulations and meaningful connections with students in the field to drive interest in trade careers.\n“Offering VR exploration into skilled trades for younger age groups gets them motivated,” says Ryan. Regarding the teams they have out in the field, Ryan adds: “Everyone we deploy at our events is [a licensed contractor] — we have firsthand knowledge about skilled trades.”\nDrawing connections between students’ experiences in VR simulations and Ryan and the team’s experiences from decades in the field is a powerful combination. It takes multiple interactions with a student to help them make an informed decision on what career they want and fill in some steps on their path to their desired job.\n“I really like talking to seventh and eighth graders,” Ryan says regarding helping students craft their training pathways. “When we do a spring event, we want to get them thinking about next year’s curriculum and the electives that they might have available to them. Do you have a shop class next year, etc.?”\nHaving an interested party help them connect the dots can make a big difference in how successfully a student navigates their school system. Data can also be a powerful tool for empowering counselors and CTE instructors to have these conversations as well.\nUsing data to increase impact\nGiving students and job seekers access to a wider range of career options and feeding their curiosity with conversations with seasoned tradespeople go a long way in helping guide people onto the right pathways for them. Data also plays a role in this process, giving counselors and educators deeper insights into which careers hold the most interest for the people they serve.\nAfter users explore various careers in the Transfr headset, they can indicate their level of interest in the role. Administrators (like Ryan and his team, or instructors and counselors in a school, etc.) can dig into student responses via a robust Transfr dashboard to better understand how to help students craft their educational plans.\n“[Access to data] enhances the output [of events] too,” Ryan says. “A week or two [after the event], we can review the data and say to instructors, ‘This is the information that we got…how can you guys use that information to better connect that with your people?’”\nSo much of the modern tech world is about creating and collecting data. But despite lofty claims, oftentimes it’s hard to say what positive impact (if any) that data is having. Transfr takes data privacy and security very seriously, in our product and the VR efficacy research we do. We’re also passionate about using data to help empower students to make more informed decisions.\n“I love that [Ryan and team] are thinking about the significance of data,” Amanda says. “And the fact that they’re acknowledging that that could help bridge a really important gap and it’s another valuable service that they get to offer to all of the partners that they work with.”\nIndustry partners provide opportunities\nOne more piece of the career-path puzzle that organizations like Big Ideas help fill in for students is connections to industry partners. It’s one thing to show students and job seekers a job they might like and even to point them in the direction of a training program and/or the basic skills they’ll need to do the job. Connecting those students to possible employers (or apprenticeship/on-the-job training opportunities, etc.) takes this to the next level.\n“[We have industry partners who] come in to say ‘Hey, how can we be helping you?’” Ryan explains. “One of our partners has an apprenticeship program where they’ll teach you diesel mechanics right in-house — you don’t have to go to technical college. It’s learn while you earn… there are just some amazing career opportunities to be had out there.”\nGetting students to think outside of the four-year university track and helping them see opportunities in their areas where they can start building their careers drives home to students that they can do this! When students get this kind of support, it changes their whole way of thinking, Amanda explains, giving voice to a hypothetical student, filled with hope for their possible future:\n“I feel good about myself. I feel like I have this positive future ahead of me! I might be able to stay in my community and start a family, buy a house… all the things that I want to do!”\nWant to learn more about how K12 schools are using VR?"

  "text": "Transfr and HOSA Advance Healthcare Education with VR\nLori Hardie \nJune 10, 2024 \nShare this story\nHealthcare education is constantly evolving, especially as the evidence of new effective and innovative educational strategies arises. More and more healthcare programs and educators are waking up to the potential of virtual reality (VR) career exploration and training to revolutionize health sciences programs of all kinds. Equipped with this innovative technology, healthcare education programs can boost instructor bandwidth and increase their ability to develop well-trained individuals for healthcare recruiting pipelines.\nVR healthcare career exploration simulations give prospective healthcare professionals a look into the day-in-the-life activities of well-paying, high-demand careers, helping them make informed decisions before getting on a healthcare career training pathway. Once accepted into a health sciences training program, VR simulations can help individuals safely practice core skills in a risk-free, immersive environment, where a virtual coach provides immediate feedback based on their in-sim actions.\nThat’s why we’re so excited to announce our partnership with HOSA — the organization that empowers Future Health Professionals. Building the most robust VR health sciences simulations possible (led by a team of Certified Healthcare Simulation Educators guided by the Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice™ recommended by INACSL) is all about helping more people find their own unique pathway to career success, and the support of organizations like HOSA helps reinforce that mission and bring us all closer to our shared goal of building the next generation of healthcare professionals.\nExciting VR efficacy research results\nFor an example of why VR health sciences training is so exciting, consider a recent efficacy study conducted by the Transfr Learning Intelligence team. The study compared immersive virtual reality (VR) health sciences training to traditional slide deck training and showed significant learning gains when using VR for healthcare skills training.\nIn the study, participants learned how to obtain a blood pressure measurement — some via immersive VR training, some via reading information contained in a slide deck. The results were outstanding: The VR group demonstrated significantly higher learning gains evaluated by pre- and post-test scores. This underscores the power of VR technology in creating engaging and impactful learning experiences.\nThe anonymous study participants were also very excited about learning via health sciences VR simulations and had the following to say about the experience:\n“I really, really like the simulation, honestly. I’m a VR student. I’ve tried many games, many simulations. I’ve tried medical simulations… that weren’t as easy to use as this one”\n“I really do like the noises in the background. It kind of makes it feel more realistic… I think this is more engaging than watching a YouTube video.”\nPartnering with HOSA to revolutionize health sciences education\nAs partners of HOSA, Transfr is committed to helping advance healthcare education. VR training can be a unique and effective way to enhance student skills and knowledge in various healthcare fields. The immersive nature of VR allows for realistic simulations, interactive scenarios, and practical experiences that closely mimic real-world healthcare environments.

  "text": "NCHSE Endorses Transfr Health Sciences VR Simulations\nLori Hardie \nFebruary 22, 2024 \nShare this story\nFor years, Transfr has been developing cutting-edge simulations to change the way people discover new careers and train for them. Along the way, we have worked closely with countless Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) as well as credentialing bodies, industry partners, and other organizations to make sure that our content aligns with the real-world needs of these vital sectors.\nIn the health sciences realm, this meant building a team of in-house experts with decades of experience in healthcare to help make sure our Virtual Healthcare Clinic (VHC) simulations are as effective as possible. As a result, we’ve been able to develop industry-leading healthcare simulations aimed at helping to address the workforce gap that’s facing this crucial sector. Increasing the number of skilled healthcare professionals and empowering instructors to help train this next generation has always been one of our central goals.\n“We are dedicated to designing training content that supports the preparation and education of health professionals,” said Hannah Schroeder, MSN-Ed, RN, CNE, CHSE, PCCN, Sr. Manager of Health Sciences Content Strategy & Programs at Transfr. “Our focus on creating active and engaging experiences that incorporate the application and analysis of knowledge, performance-based elements, and integration of feedback opportunities enables us to be part of the efforts to help improve the overall competence of healthcare professionals and their proficiency in the core competencies needed for healthcare professionals as noted by the Institute of Medicine in 2003.”\nOur recent endorsement by the National Consortium for Health Sciences Education (NCHSE) shows that we’re on the right path! Endorsements like this from organizations like the NCHSE are independent corroboration that the quality of our virtual health sciences instruction is high and that these simulations can have a positive impact on training programs.\nTransfr’s health sciences VR simulations enhance training\nThe NCHSE’s mission is to “stimulate creative and innovative leadership for ensuring a well-prepared health workforce.” The organization is home to a wealth of experience and expertise regarding what makes for effective healthcare training. While VR simulation labs have long been a staple of healthcare education and training, many instructors are wary about integrating VR into their programs — the NCHSE’s endorsement may help allay some of their concerns.\n“After personally engaging in Transfr’s virtual simulation series, I am excited to celebrate the new dimension this resource brings to today’s CTE classroom, particularly in the health science sphere.” said Cindy LeCoq, NCHSE Certificate Program Manager. “Focusing on the psychomotor domain, the virtual hands-on applications fills a serious void that many teachers face when health science expertise and classroom constraints inhibit student participation in healthcare skills.”\nTransfr’s VR health sciences simulations are designed to be used in conjunction with in-person training to give students the ability to safely practice core healthcare skills over and over again without risks to themselves or others, and without using costly consumable materials. Simulations also turn any room into a practice lab, saving schools and other organizations from the costs of outfitting entire single-purpose lab spaces.\nAligning to standards, empowering students and instructors\nAll Transfr training content is designed to align with industry standards and best practices to make sure that the skills which users develop accurately represent the workplaces they’ll be entering later. The simulation design process for VHC simulations is headed up by Certified Healthcare Simulation Educators who are guided by the Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice™, as recommended by the International Nurses Association for Clinical Learning and Simulation (INACSL) and the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH). VHC simulations also align with the National Health Science Standards requirements established through NCHSE’s efforts.\n“The National Consortium for Health Science Education (NCHSE) is proud to partner with Transfr in their efforts to design new and unique resources for health science classrooms,” says Nancy H. Allen, NCHSE Executive Director. “This organization has developed immersive, simulated training modules to help students build healthcare knowledge and skills that will reinforce the National Health Science Standards. Transfr has focused alignment to our NCHSE standards throughout the creation of these modules. NCHSE believes Transfr’s health sciences VR simulations and training will serve to promote students’ interest in health professions, increase their performance on national certifications and provide them with the skills needed to secure a job in the healthcare industry.”\nEquipped with these detailed simulations, healthcare instructors of all kinds can empower their students to hone their skills in a supportive VR environment, guided by both simulated coaches and real-world instructors. It’s heartening to see organizations like the NCHSE take the lead in endorsing the industry-transforming potential that VR has to offer.\n“Virtual reality is immersive and is available to all,” says Cindy. “Students can review the healthcare skills and with return demonstration achieve competency all completely independent of the health science instructor. This VR demonstration, practice and assessment of skills gives the student the confidence and knowledge to step into most healthcare practicums with ease.”\nWant to learn more about the effectiveness of Transfr’s health sciences simulations?\nLori Hardie \nDr Lori Hardie, RN, NPD-BC, CHSE, and Transfr Senior Director of Health Sciences, has spent almost 30 years in healthcare.

  "text": "VR Career Exploration Reveals Career Paths for Youths\nJack Cieslak \nFebruary 9, 2024 \nShare this story\nIf you’ve been around the K12 education space at all (or have kids or can remember being one!), you’ll attest that it’s never too early to start thinking about your career and your career pathway. Going from a wide-eyed high schooler to a seasoned professional is a long and twisty road (as Transfr’s VP of Learning Intelligence, Yun Jin Rho will tell you).\nTechnology can give schools and youth organizations a powerful new tool to help engage young people and connect them with meaningful jobs in high-growth industries that pay well and boast upward mobility. We sat down on Upward, the Transfr podcast with Ryan Ott, Executive Director of Big Ideas (a Minnesota nonprofit specializing in helping young people get into trade jobs), and Amanda Longtain — Director of Economic Development at Transfr who has spent much of her career helping people escape cycles of generational poverty.\n“I’ve worked in education for 18 years,” Amanda says. “I’ve designed anti-poverty programs for Transfr by either scaffolding our technology into existing curricula or designing programs from the ground up.”\nAmanda and Ryan talked about the importance of career exploration and connecting young learners with high-quality career paths as well as how VR can help drive interest in these roles and give young people hope for future career success.\nDriving excitement for the skilled trades with VR\nWhile not every young person can afford the same access to new technology, many young people are highly interested in computers and VR (and many young people own or have access to a smartphone). Transfr has discovered in many efficacy studies — and Ryan corroborates with his experiences in the field — that VR can be a compelling addition to a career exploration program:\n“Young people now are really into gaming, they’re brought up on the internet, with all this digital technology,” Ryan says. “At Big Ideas, we kind of talked about that it’s like ‘The Matrix’ and we want to bring them into the real world.”\nTechnology allows the Big Ideas team to connect with young learners and meet them where they’re at. Many young people think that jobs in the skilled trades (carpentry, construction, electrical work, etc.) are old-fashioned and may not be considering them as career paths. Big Ideas is constantly on the go, using their custom trailers to bring the excitement of VR and trade jobs to schools. Simulations and conversations with real-life tradespeople on-site can be a powerful combination, leading students to reexamine professions they might not have thought seriously about.\n“I’m a licensed contractor — everybody we deploy as staff in our events is — so when we’re talking to people, we have firsthand knowledge about different skilled trades,” Ryan explains. “We offer VR exploration into skilled trades for younger age groups, just to get them motivated, get them interested, give them an idea what the trades look like.”\nReal people driving real change\nVR needs to be part of a robust web of services and interactions that drive career pathway selection to make real changes in the way people learn about and choose careers. Ryan and his team leverage their decades of experience in the skilled trades to have real conversations and make real connections with young people who may be looking for direction and have questions about how to build their careers.\nRyan’s career journey was far from smooth, so getting to share his story with young people facing an uncertain job market and changing work landscapes is meaningful for him and helps him connect with students.\n“We went back to my high school and I got to work the event, which was good for me,” he shares. “Of course, it’s all new faculty and staff, but at the end of the day, the shop teacher said, ‘Hey, you know, we’ve got this one kid, who sometimes shows up and sometimes doesn’t, he rarely participates, you know… And as I was watching them walk out to the VR trailer, I was thinking, this is a 50/50 shot, this kid is either going to leave for the day or go in the trailer… And when he stayed, the shop teacher was like ‘This is the first time I’ve seen this kid participate during the whole class. You guys captured his imagination.’”\nVirtual reality combined with real professionals and human connection has the potential to change the entire course of someone’s life. Ryan’s conclusion to the shop teacher story drives that home:\n“The shop teacher saw us talking to his student and he stayed to try out the simulations. That was powerful for that teacher. I think that’s the value of real people having real conversations.”\nInspiring learners, building a brighter future\nConnecting with students and job seekers of all ages is a huge hurdle for career counselors, teachers, administrators, and everyone else who tries to help people find their unique path to a meaningful career. Experiences like the ones Big Ideas provides, using skilled tradespeople and VR simulations, don’t just inspire people to pick a career path — they also give them hope. To do their best, people need to believe a better life is possible. With people like the Big Ideas team out there, maybe there’s a little more hope in the world as well.\n“One of the things that we talk about at Transfr is how these experiences also provide a learner with hope,” says Amanda. “Even though hope is hard to measure, it’s literally what pushes us forward to that next step.”\nWant to learn more about how K12 schools are using VR?\nJack Cieslak \nJack Cieslak is the Editorial Director at Transfr. He’s worked in tech for over a decade, writing for Amazon, CB Insights, and Sisense, among others. When he’s not behind a computer, he enjoys martial arts, gardening, hiking, and of course, reading.

  "text": "Enhancing K12 Schools with VR\nK12 schools are where the foundations of future career success are built. Through a variety of career exploration activities, combined with guidance from instructors and counselors, and innovative CTE programs, young learners can build their own unique pathways to career success.\nVirtual reality (VR) presents unique opportunities to help students learn about the wide variety of career options available to them, especially in non-college-degree tracks. Immersive VR experiences are a uniquely engaging way to give them a first-person look at what it’s like to live a day in the life of a particular occupation. Simulated hands-on training in VR allows them to safely develop confidence and competence in the skills they’ll need for career success. The sense of accomplishment that goes along with skill acquisition often fuels their visions of career success.\nVR is highly engaging\nNot every young student is interested in the latest technology, but VR often captures their imaginations. It’s not uncommon to hear that students who aren’t very interested in career education change their behaviors when presented with the opportunity to investigate different jobs in VR.\n“Students LOVE Transfr VR,” says Sarah Jane Walker, CTE Counselor at Tyler Independent School District in Texas. “When I arrive at school with our headsets, I get a cheer from the class. It’s something students really look forward to!”\nJob markets in the US are evolving rapidly and students are often unaware of the career options available to them or how to secure these well-paying jobs in high-growth industries. While guest speakers and field trips to work sites are compelling experiences, they can be expensive and difficult to scale. Immersive VR career exploration brings the workplace to the school — even in fields that students might not be very knowledgeable about.\n“Transfr allows students to explore lots of different occupations to get them to think outside of the box,” says Diana Ollis, a Career Development Coordinator a Union County Public School in North Carolina. “Students need to realize that there are lots of opportunities out there, not just what you see in the community at home.”\nWest Alabama Works takes Transfr headsets on the road for their Worlds of Work events, giving 8th and 9th graders a chance to dig into VR experiences of an array of occupations. These events boosted CTE enrollment by almost 20% when they were initially rolled out. In West Virginia, Workforce Development Board Mid-Ohio Valley’s summer CTE Explore Camp takes 9th and 10th graders through a week of career exploration activities, including VR time. Again, VR has huge potential to give students insights into careers they may not have considered:\n“I like showing people how to use the VR to try jobs they wouldn’t have an opportunity to do otherwise,” says Russell Spencer, a VR Tech who helped facilitate the camp. “This allows them to experience jobs without needing access to the costly real equipment or having to travel to where the equipment is.”\nVR skills training: Safety and cost savings\nBeyond career exploration, learning new skills in VR is also uniquely engaging in that it allows students to start actively building skills almost right away — as opposed to sitting through lengthy classroom lectures or book-learning stints before picking up a tool. The excitement experienced during VR learning is referred to as “the joy of doing” by Keith Lyle, PhD, Transfr’s Director of Learning Sciences.\n“This joyful reaction seems to be driven in part by how easily the sims capture the learner’s attention,” Keith says.\nVR skills training also offers unique safety benefits for all learners — especially K12 students. Learning any skilled trade requires an element of risk at various points during the learning journey, however, starting that process in VR lets students develop core job skills in a virtual setting that’s free from the traditional risks of injury.\n“Technology has evolved,” says Johnnie Parker, a seasoned electrician and instructor with decades of experience in the field. “Today’s students have new options that can keep them safer as they develop the skills they’ll need in the field.”\nStudents can work on cars and other vehicles, handle dangerous or costly materials, and work with flames and sharp objects in VR without the risk of harm to themselves or others or damaging real-world equipment or property. However, the safety skills they learn in the virtual setting translate to the real world. Their virtual coach guides them every step of the way, making sure that they are taking the proper precautions and providing helpful reminders when needed.\nVirtual coaches provide calm, consistent instruction across every interaction, empowering human instructors to give students more personal attention while other students use VR. Present VR systems cannot replace human instructors and real-world, hands-on training to reinforce the skills learned in VR — instead, VR skills instruction augments human educators, giving them another unique and powerful tool to help prepare students for the working world.\nVR training inspires hope for the future\nA growing body of research is showing time and time again that students really enjoy VR learning. But VR’s benefits go much deeper — allowing learners to see possibilities for the future they maybe hadn’t considered. We know students “can’t be what they can’t see…” The sense of hope and connection VR offers is both incredibly unique and hard to quantify.\nLiving in an increasingly complex world of mounting uncertainty, it’s natural for young people to wonder what their futures will look like. Instructors, counselors, and trade professionals need to be realistic with young learners about the challenges they’ll face. That being said, there are amazing opportunities out there for the coming generations in a variety of fields, especially trades that don’t require a university degree to get started.\nTime spent in VR, coupled with meaningful conversations with professionals and educators, can help students plan effective career pathways towards well-paying jobs in high-growth industries. It can also give them the spark they need to the steps they need to take to turn this plan into reality:\n“Something we talk about at Transfr is how these experiences give learners hope,” says Amanda Longtain, Director of Programs at Transfr. “Even though hope is hard to measure, it’s literally what pushes us forward.”\nWant to learn more about how K12 schools are using VR?"

However, in the US, these companies are struggling to fill open roles in their clean, modern facilities. This is ironic given that many roles don’t require a four-year college degree to get started on a career path with good wages and upward mobility.\nEven with this opportune combination — a vital industry, lots of job openings, and no college degree requirement for many — the problem of helping students and job seekers from pools of undiscovered talent get into these roles won’t solve itself. Like every other human endeavor worth doing, it’ll take a combination of technology, relationships, and dedication to solve.\nThis interactive infographic about manufacturing in the US is a handy guide to some of the amazing opportunities available in the manufacturing industry, including open roles by state across 10 spotlight states, starting salaries, and projected earnings after 4 years in the role. There are also collected stories from Transfr partners that are working to connect job seekers with the training they need to secure well-paying jobs in their areas. It all ties together into a story of opportunity, education, and empowerment — one that’s being supercharged right now with VR career exploration and AR technology.\nHuge opportunities in the manufacturing space\nThe recent upsurge in job openings at manufacturers of all kinds is a huge opportunity for students and job seekers. The manufacturing sector in the US is poised to grow to almost 300,000 open roles by 2025. These roles encompass a wide array of focus areas across the entire manufacturing process and in a variety of industries — manufacturing isn’t just one type of facility or one type of experience.\nIn the Return of Manufacturing in the United States infographic, the four manufacturing jobs highlighted are maintenance/repair technicians, assemblers, welders, and machinists. All these careers offer strong starting salaries and career paths with upward mobility — without college degrees.\nThe spotlight states (Arkansas, Alabama, Texas, etc.) all represent places where manufacturing is surging back in a big way. Organizations and employers there have committed to helping build strong talent pipelines to provide skilled, engaged workers for these vital roles.\nBuilding manufacturing buzz with VR and AR career exploration\nTo fill this flood of job openings and keep the engine of manufacturing humming, educators, employers, and workforce boards (as well as other community organizations, like the Boys & Girls Club) are working to change the way people see these jobs by showing them what these careers entail and what modern manufacturing workplaces are really like:\n“It’s important to change the optics of what manufacturing looks like today,” says Sarah Hartwick, VP of Education and Workforce Policy with the Illinois Manufacturer’s Association. “It’s no longer dark, dirty, and dangerous. It’s clean, sustainable, high-tech, diverse… And if you visit a shop floor today — you will be blown away. It’s incredible.”\nOrganizations building the future of manufacturing\nIn addition to displaying the vast number of job opportunities in different manufacturing roles, this interactive map also links out to a variety of inspiring customer stories from Transfr partners in these spotlight states. In Florida, AmSkills uses its mobile career boot camps to bring VR headsets and support teams directly to communities where transportation is a serious challenge. This combination of high technology and human ingenuity is opening doors and helping connect people with opportunities in their areas.\n“One of the problems in society today is that there’s little chance to explore different careers,” says AmSkills CEO Tom Mudano. “How can someone know if they want to be a machinist or work in robotics? AmSkills Career Discovery Bootcamps allow them to explore these different careers in manufacturing and the Transfr system allows us to provide even more opportunity to show careers that we might not be able to provide otherwise.”\nWest Alabama Works helps students explore careers with VR headsets via their Worlds of Work events. Students from all across their service area come together for various job readiness activities. Since deploying Transfr, these schools have seen a marked uptick in CTE enrollment.\n“This program is creating 5-star recruits,” says Donny Jones, COO of West Alabama Works. “Teachers are empowered and engaged, students are better qualified and ready for success on day one. Students with a higher academic achievement rate are being attracted to industry — creating leaders of the future — and more kids are staying in the community because of local, well-paying jobs.”\nWith the right combination of caring, dedicated human teams, and technology, including VR career exploration and VR manufacturing training, the potential for change is immense. Dig into this detailed infographic and explore more amazing stories and opportunities.\nReady to learn more about how manufacturing in the US and VR?\nJack Cieslak \nJack Cieslak is the Editorial Director at Transfr.

  "text": "Technical College System of Georgia Enhances Health Sciences Training with VR\nTechnical College System of Georgia Augments Health Sciences Programs with Transfr’s Virtual Health Clinic\nTable of Contents \nSince the summer of 2020, the Technical College System of Georgia has integrated virtual reality (VR) training simulations from Transfr into their programs. In 2023, the colleges started implementing Transfr’s Virtual Health Clinic (VHC).\nHealthcare students in a variety of disciplines will be able to develop confidence and competence in core skills. The VHC’s robust, peer-reviewed curriculum has been designed and developed using best practices for teaching and learning, including the Healthcare Simulation Standards of Best Practice™. Content included is based upon extensive market research, accreditation requirements, federally recognized guidelines, and industry-specific standards.\nGrowing with Transfr: Expanding VR with VHC\nHaving used Transfr VR simulations since 2020, the team at TCSG already had an idea of the quality and range of options available from Transfr and how new sims could be applied to their programs. As recipient of the Strengthening Community College Grant (which began in early 2021), TCSG has been focused on finding engaging, top-notch educational tech tools to support workforce development across the state of Georgia; VR training is just one such technology.\n“The primary thing that attracted us to Transfr was the depth of the training library,” said Keith Fletcher, former Executive Director for TCSG’s SCC grant. “There are an awful lot of VR systems out there, but they are generally very limited. Transfr has quality training across a large library.”\nThe VHC officially launched in April of 2023, and Instructional Designer Jaime Wadowiec, also attached to the SCC grant, said she was excited to integrate them into health sciences programs.\n\"It' s been exciting to be a part of Transfr's growth, which is moving in the same direction as our own in terms of course needs. Healthcare is a prime example of how the goals of the SCC grant — getting more folks out into the workplace into the workforce, specifically Certified Nurse Assistants (CNAs) and so on — are aligned with Transfr’s direction and these new healthcare sims.\" \nJaime Wadowiec\nInstructional Designer \nTCSG and Transfr: Partners in virtual health sciences learning\nBuilding relationships and partnering with organizations who share our goals and values is core to our mission at Transfr. Sharing design ideas for simulations under development and seeking insight and feedback from clients and external stakeholders are part of how we strengthen relationships and ensure that new content meets the identified gaps and needs of organizations, as well as people in the pools of undiscovered talent who have the potential to step into the workforce.\n“We’d been in contact with the Director of Health Sciences and gave her a sense of what we were doing in our programs, then showed an early demo to our faculty,” Jaime explains. “There’s a lot of enthusiasm here for healthcare specifically and I think in part because we’ve worked so closely with Transfr get things off the ground. So it’s been really exciting!”\nThe quality of the simulations, Keith says, is also a major consideration in implementing the VHC in programming:\n“ I think that the VHC probably are some of the best medical VR training sims out there — and I taught medics for eight years! That quality is going to make a huge difference in the gap between classroom learning and practice. \nKeith Fletcher, Former Executive Director\nTCSG’s Strengthening Community Colleges grant \nVR health sciences simulations: Exceptional practice, quality content\nThe ability to do numerous practice repetitions is vital for every skill and profession. In health sciences settings, it can be difficult to outfit and staff simulation labs or find clinical sites where students can get the kind of practice hours needed. VHC simulations, under the watchful eye of a virtual coach who provides consistent instruction with impeccable attention to detail, is one solution to this challenge.\n“Some people need to look at a process or part of anatomy ten times to really understand it,” Keith explained. “VR training gives students more independence to repeat sections and skills until they really understand the content. It also removes the peer pressure of having their classmates’ eyes on them as they try to master things. It’s win-win!”\nJaime reported that the content of the VHC simulations is also top-notch:\n“Having had the opportunity to sit down with the instructional designers in the healthcare program, it was very clear to me that they took a lot of time to get the verbiage right to make sure that the student is coached effectively. It’s just such a well thought-out product from start to back. The virtual coach is encouraging without being over the top. And I think that students really respond to the natural flow of the dialogue from the coach. The flow from one learning objective to the next is also smooth and natural. It’s a tremendous product.”"

  "text": "Arkansas Office of Skills Development Leverages VR\nExecutive Summary\nThe mission of The Office of Skills Development (OSD) is to strategically invest in all levels of the Arkansas workforce, raising education and skill levels to improve economic achievement for workers and companies. Guided by the experience and insight of industry professionals, business owners, educators, and other stakeholders through the State Career Education and Workforce Development Board (CEWD), the OSD undertakes a variety of programs, including several statewide initiatives, in order to achieve these goals. Leveraging Transfr’s immersive work-based virtual reality learning platform gave the OSD new ways to educate students and job seekers about the many high-demand job opportunities the state has to offer. Transfr helps the OSD reach more students and help more job seekers discover new roles, setting the stage for future career and workforce development success.\nCreating classroom-to-career workforce training opportunities for Arkansas residents with VR\nHelping people find their unique niche in Arkansas’s evolving workforce is always top of mind for the OSD team. When the OSD rolled out several workforce initiatives, they determined that new and innovative methods were needed to reach their audience and enhance Arkansas’ workforce. There were numerous roles in high-demand industries going unfilled, and countless students and job seekers who needed the right knowledge and guidance to change their lives.\nOSD Director Cody Waits says one of the questions that comes to mind when addressing how to make workforce initiatives successful is, “How do we integrate technology into workforce development?”\nAwareness is always the first step towards helping someone find the right role, but existing practices were lagging behind the state’s ambitious programs. Traditional career fairs and other opportunities to learn about jobs, training possibilities, or open roles at local companies hadn’t kept pace with the state’s rapidly changing work environment.\n“How is someone going to come talk to students about the programs they offer and have them make a decision without ever experiencing the job?” Cody asks. “ So, one of my first thoughts when I saw Transfr was ‘What a great opportunity to engage students differently by leveraging technology in a virtual environment!’ Now they can explore not just one career but a broad swath of occupations that exist and make their own decisions about what they might be interested in.”\nVR career exploration and skills training positively impacts students\nA leading challenge when attempting to bring new workers into established trades, like manufacturing and construction, is dealing with outdated ideas about what those jobs are and how to train for them. On the student side of that equation, a high-tech offering like hands-on VR training simulations from Transfr can get students excited and drive engagement in career and technical education (CTE) programs.\nThe OSD’s Transfr headsets were initially deployed at 14 community colleges across the state (now up to 20 at time of writing), where they are used by adult students at the sites and by affiliated high schools. The response has been powerful.\n“Students get pretty excited after they understand just what Transfr can do,” says John Bratton, an instructor at Arkansas State University (ASU) Three Rivers. “Once they understand the depth of the simulations within each occupation, they’re excited to use classroom sets and really dive in.”\nTransfr simulations aren’t just driving interest in other fields, they’re also helping students in training programs build the skills they need to graduate and find great jobs in high-demand fields.\n“The students were excited when VR was introduced — and the diesel tech program has lots of new shiny toys — but this is cool to add in,” says ASU Beebe instructor Connor Tate. “I had one student who was having issues grasping some of the material on a mechanical level, but with VR he was a natural. He could move at his own pace and really picked up the concepts.”\nThe mutual benefits of using VR in skilled trade capacities help students, schools, and vital industries: VR makes the trades seem more interesting and attractive to younger students and job seekers. Then, once they get into these programs, using VR helps drive success in acquiring key skills. As an added bonus, schools and training centers of all kinds can reap the benefits of Transfr without expensive facilities or costly consumable materials.\nWith Transfr headsets in place at community colleges and schools across Arkansas, more students and job seekers are aware of the unique opportunities that they could take advantage of in a variety of industries.\n“Students love Transfr for career exploration,” Associate Director Stephanie Isaacs says. “When they are able to use that headset and see what’s involved in each job, you get a more engaging experience.”\nTransfr’s potential for training and VR career exploration is apparent to other stakeholders in Arkansas’s workforce development ecosystem, who see its ability to help learners in high school and beyond grow and learn in ways that will help them take advantage of well-paying jobs in Arkansas.\n“Lasting growth means engaging students early, building accurate and tangible awareness, correcting perceptions and ensuring students have experiences that will guide them throughout their education,” says Joe Rollins, Workforce Development Director, Northwest Arkansas Council. “Transfr absolutely does that.”\nUnlocking the future with expanded VR skills training\nThe OSD’s initial successes in high schools and community colleges have fueled increased interest in rolling out Transfr to more locations, organizations, learners, and people across the state.\n“Part of our vision for the future is getting these headsets into our local workforce boards, correctional facilities, and industry partners,” Cody explains. “We know that there’s a population of underemployed and unemployed individuals who are looking to make informed career decisions. Transfr can assist in this.”\nThe Office of Skills Development strategically invests in statewide workforce development and ongoing training programs to help drive economic prosperity for individuals and businesses. This work and investments are positively impacting Arkansas communities statewide and strengthening families. Arkansas is a leader in workforce development and home to several world industry leading companies such as Hytrol, Walmart Inc., Tyson Foods, and J.B. Hunt.\nEquipped with Transfr’s VR skills training and career exploration simulations, the State of Arkansas and Transfr are creating opportunities for residents that are virtually limitless."

The board, which serves nine counties in West Virginia, takes a multifaceted approach to workforce development and has built strong partnerships with Transfr, the Building and Trades Council, and in local high schools. The team at WDB-MOV takes a hands-on approach to career exploration and training, leveraging Transfr simulations. VR simulations empower workforce professionals to serve the population without specialized equipment or access to expensive facilities. Since partnering with Transfr, the Board has reached 1,468 distinct users (both virtual skills training and career exploration), who have completed over 4,173 simulations.\nWDB-MOV is a hub for a variety of vital programs aimed at helping increase employment in the area, serving adult and dislocated workers as well as youth. All are designed to help people with specific employment barriers enter the workforce.\nIn an attempt to intensify their outreach efforts with local youth, WDB-MOV also ran a highly successful CTE Explore Camp. This week-long camp focused on expanding knowledge of trade jobs for incoming 9th and 10th graders who might consider going into Career and Technical Education programs. In addition to daily spotlight speakers who shared their career journeys with students, there was a variety of other content to help them make decisions about their classroom-to-career pathways. Students were directed to various Transfr career exploration simulations based on their expressed interests, but were also given the freedom to engage with any other sims during their Transfr headset sessions."

  "text": "Union County Public Schools Expand Career Exploration\nMiddle school is a time of transition and possibility. Students struggle to find their place in social groups and in their academic journeys, but using this time of potential and imagination to think about career pathways is vital as well. How schools engage students can make all the difference in whether a career preparation program succeeds or not.\nFor Brian Davis, Director of Career Readiness at UCPS, increasing access to career exploration activities was top of mind. UCPS already had programs in place to facilitate conversations with students and lead them towards classes and other training programs down the line that could help them secure a job, but delivering exciting, inspiring experiences at scale was a challenge — that’s where Transfr was able to help.\nThe decision to augment human instructors with VR technology isn’t always an easy one, but for Brian, it was exciting. He says Union School District’s choice to integrate Transfr into their programs was driven by the possibilities that it could open up for students and educators:\n“I first heard about Transfr at a conference and started doing my research,” Brian says. “Specifically, we were looking for portability — we wanted to bring the headsets to multiple different school locations, plus use them for special events like summer camps. Transfr was perfect for that.”\nOnce Transfr was deployed, it really took off with students and instructors. Transfr’s portability allows the two career readiness instructors to bring VR Career exploration headsets to various district locations, driving up student interest in career pathways. \n“The kids were thrilled,” says Elizabeth Higginbotham, Career Development Coordinator. “They would see me come in with my cart and their eyes would light up, especially in the alternative school that I’m at.”\nStudent adoption has been awesome, with 1,374 students completing 1,737 career exploration simulations in the 2021-2022 school year. This success has driven the district to double its headset count to 20 for the 2022-2023 school year, opting for All-Access headsets, which will allow students to go from career exploration to skills training in Transfr’s Virtual Training Facility."

  "text": "How Educators Can Connect the Classroom to the Real World with Tech\nThroughout the history of education, keeping students engaged and motivated has been a primary concern. Traditional teaching methods often struggle to connect academic content with real-world applications, leading to disengagement and a lack of curiosity among students. Many educators find it difficult to bridge this gap due to limited resources, time constraints, or lack of access to relevant materials and are constantly on the hunt for new classroom experiences. That being said, creative strategies and novel technologies can help teachers bring real-world experiences into the classroom, enhancing student engagement and learning outcomes.\nThe Importance of Real-World Connections in Education\nConnecting what students learn in the classroom with what they’re likely to encounter in the real world is crucial for keeping students invested and helping them see the relevance of what they are learning. Engaging classroom activities help foster student excitement and curiosity by linking academic concepts to tangible, everyday experiences. Seeing how their studies apply to life beyond the classroom can make students more invested and eager to learn. This approach can also help students better grasp abstract concepts.\nReal-world connections in the classroom encourage critical thinking and problem-solving by challenging students to apply their knowledge to practical situations. By interacting with authentic scenarios, students develop the ability to think critically and adapt to new challenges, skills that are essential for success in future careers.\nCreative ways to bring the real world into the classroom\nOne effective way to connect classroom learning to the real world is by inviting guest speakers and organizing virtual field trips. Industry professionals can provide valuable insights into different career paths and offer students a glimpse into real-world applications of their studies. Virtual tours, such as exploring museums or historical sites, allow students to experience environments and events they might otherwise never have the opportunity to see, broadening their horizons without leaving the school.\nProject-based learning is another powerful strategy. Working on engaging classroom activities, built around real-life projects such as designing a community initiative, creating a mock business plan, or solving everyday math problems gives students real-world experience and skills that are directly applicable outside the classroom. These activities encourage collaboration, creativity, and deeper understanding.\nClassroom simulations like mock trials, debates, or scientific experiments drive students to actively engage with course material in a way that mirrors real-world scenarios. New classroom experiences like these immersive activities help solidify learning by making abstract concepts more relatable and applicable.\nTechnology also plays a critical role in bringing the real world into the classroom. Modern tools and platforms make learning interactive and engaging in ways that were previously unimaginable. For example, virtual reality (VR) simulations can be powerful student engagement tools and create immersive environments where students interact with lifelike scenarios, such as walking through ancient ruins or exploring complex environments or workplaces. \nThese experiences provide opportunities for interactive and transformative learning. Immersive VR experiences like Transfr help bridge this gap by offering VR based tools that make real-world learning accessible to students everywhere. \nDr. OP McCubbins, associate professor of Agricultural Education at Mississippi State University, had this to say while speaking on the Transfr panel “Can VR Advance Learning?”\n“I think the findings from the Learning Intelligence Team tell us that immersive learning works. Hands-on learning experiences work; it doesn’t have to be a real-world experience. It can be a simulated experience. I think that there’s lots of benefits to being able to offer some of those simulated experiences.”\nThe Role of VR in Real-World Classroom Learning\nVirtual reality (VR) has emerged as one of many transformative student engagement tools in the worlds of education, training, and career exploration.\nWhat is VR?\nVR or virtual reality is a technology that immerses users in a fully simulated digital environment. Using specialized hardware and software, VR creates experiences that mimic real-world scenarios like workplaces.\nMany classroom instructors ask “How does VR help with learning?” In the classroom, VR can allow students to experience environments and activities that would be impossible, expensive, or even dangerous to explore firsthand — walking through ancient ruins, exploring outer space, or visiting a manufacturing floor or construction site. These experiences engage students in ways that traditional teaching methods often cannot.\n“The VR training was very effective for me, personally,” says Michael, an electrical construction student. “It was very informative and precise and got into really good detail as well — not just in terms of the physical side of seeing what you’ll be doing, but also the underlying knowledge you need in the field.”\nVR also makes learning more inclusive, removing geographic and economic barriers. It fosters collaboration and creativity by encouraging students to work together in dynamic, interactive environments. By providing immersive, interactive, and accessible learning experiences, VR helps educators connect students to real-world learning in meaningful ways. Tools like Transfr make these experiences even more impactful by offering innovative solutions that align with educators’ teaching goals. By embracing innovative approaches, educators can inspire the next generation to connect what they learn in the classroom to the broader world around them.\nDr. Yun Jin Rho, VP of Learning Intelligence at Transfr, leaves us with this finding regarding the effectiveness of VR learning:\n“We found that learning from VR simulations had more positive outcomes than the traditional learning methods. These learning gains didn’t just apply to one group of students or a certain group of students, but to all different types of novice learners.”\nLooking to Secure Funding for Your Career Exploration or Workforce Training Program?\nGet Your FREE eBook"

  "text": "Active vs Passive Learning: Technology Shifting Learning Methods\nBlog\nPassive vs Active Learning:\nHow Technology Helps to Build Essential Learning Skills\nTable of Contents\nEducation is key to helping people from all walks of life get on their own personal pathways to well-paying jobs in high-growth careers. But what’s the best way to get students and job seekers the skills they’ll need to secure jobs with upward mobility in the workforce of the future?\nThe conversation around active vs passive learning highlights how these two main learning methods contribute to acquiring essential skills. With the advent of advanced technologies like virtual reality, also called VR, the education landscape continues to change at a dizzying pace — offering new ways to foster engagement, critical thinking, and adaptability in learners.\nUnderstanding Essential Learning Skills\nActive vs passive learning\nWhile there are a variety of ways to classify learning methods, two primary approaches dominate: Active and passive learning.\nWhat is active learning?\nActive learning involves participation and engagement. Learners apply knowledge, solve problems, or discuss concepts. This method promotes critical thinking, collaboration, and real-world skill application.\nWhat is passive learning?\nPassive learning, meanwhile, is more observational. Students absorb knowledge through lectures, reading, or videos, requiring minimal interaction. However, as Dr. Keith Lyle, Director of Learning Sciences at Transfr, explains, active learning (like the experiences facilitated in VR) can offer specific benefits.\n“The key to success and enjoyment during learning,” says Dr. Lyle. “Is allowing the learner to actively engage with, rather than passively receive, new knowledge.” \nThis insight underscores the transformative power of active engagement in learning environments. In Transfr studies, active learning has shown high engagement and knowledge retention rates. Passive learning, while convenient for delivering large amounts of information, may result in lower engagement and retention.\nFrom classrooms to workplaces, passive methods like lectures or training videos are often the go-to for disseminating information. However, the addition of interactive approaches, such as group projects or VR-based simulations, can help learners internalize theoretical knowledge and hone practical skills.\nThe role technology plays in active vs passive learning\nTechnological advancements have made passive learning more accessible than ever. Video libraries like YouTube offer a wealth of content, including ‘how-to’ tutorials and deep dives into various trades, skills, and hobbies. The rise of educational podcasts has also created convenient, on-demand learning opportunities.\nRecent advancements have also created new active learning opportunities: Interactive learning apps gamify problem-solving. VR simulations immerse learners in real-world scenarios that build confidence and skills in a realistic, safe, and engaging manner. Studies demonstrate that actively engaging with VR simulations results in better retention and performance compared to passive methods. Learners trained using Transfr retained 62% of steps in an electrical construction task compared to 51% in a passive environment​.\nDr. Lyle further emphasizes, “I’ve been studying memory for 25 years. I’ve done countless classroom studies, but what was missing was a more interactive element, like you have with VR.” \nPersonalized active learning through adaptive technology\nAdaptive technology enhances active learning by tailoring experiences to individual needs. AI-driven feedback systems, such as Transfr’s digital instructors, offer real-time guidance, helping learners navigate complex scenarios, learning as they go. This kind of immediate feedback provided in an interactive, judgment-free environment helps learners build confidence while honing their skills.\nThe benefits of personalized learning extend beyond individual learners. Teachers in large classrooms can leverage technology to manage groups more effectively, giving them more time to focus on students who need additional support. This personalized approach fosters a more interactive and inclusive educational experience, ensuring every student is set up for success.\nPersonalized active learning through adaptive technology\nWhich learning method is better — passive or active learning? Blended learning models that incorporate active and passive learning offer many benefits: Students absorb information through online lectures (passive learning) then participate in sessions focused on applying concepts through problem-solving and discussions (active learning).\nTechnology can help facilitate this balance by promoting critical thinking through simulation-based problem-solving, enhancing communication via collaborative platforms, and encouraging creativity with project-based tools. Moreover, self-directed learning empowers people to take control of their education.\nBy combining active and passive methods and integrating advanced technologies like VR and AI, we can redefine education and training. Learners not only gain theoretical knowledge but also practical experience, setting them up for success in an ever-evolving world. Here’s Dr. Lyle one last time:\n“VR simulations have the potential to make learning active in a way no other technology does.”\nTable of Contents\nSecure the Grants You Need!

  "text": "After-School All-Stars Uses Transfr VR to Boost Career Readiness\nTransfr is building classroom-to-career pathways for millions of workers who will be the future of countless industries. AfterSchool All-Stars (ASAS) mission is “to provide comprehensive after-school programs that keep children safe and help them succeed in school and life.” Several ASAS groups have already integrated VR career exploration simulations from Transfr into their programming, letting students experience a day in the life of professionals in well-paying jobs in high-growth industries.\nThe ASAS locations currently leveraging VR from Transfr in support of the ASAS mission are already seeing inspiring results! Using VR as part of the “Stars at Work” program gives ASAS participants a safe, engaging way to explore new careers and build skills for highdemand jobs. In Chicago, using Transfr’s VR Career Exploration can help schools align with the Illinois Postsecondary and Career Expectations (PaCE) framework, which is designed to provide students with guided exploration of postsecondary planning and options in a manner that is consistent with the developmental stage of each student.\nASAS’s ambitious program uses VR sims to supplement a curriculum that focuses on soft skills and career readiness. Program leaders at each site give students personalized guidance on which modules to explore based on student internships, job placements, and field trips. Even when students aren’t using the headsets themselves, watching simulations being cast live to classroom TVs allows them to benefit from additional exposure to career exploration experiences. School administrators report positive student reactions to the headsets and are eager to learn more, sharing that they see the VR experience as the future of career readiness education.\nVR career exploration broadens horizons for students and empowers staff members to work with more students in more ways. The built-in dashboard helps instructors understand which careers each student is interested in, to help them learn more about their possible career options. The combination of innovative technology and personalized attention is a winner when it comes to helping students build their unique career pathways."

  "text": "Middle School Students Find VR Career Exploration Highly Engaging\nIn 2023, Transfr collaborated with Workforce Solutions of Coastal Bend (WSCB) to survey middle school students (grades 6-8) and capture their experiences with Transfr’s Career Exploration 2.0 simulations (CE 2.0). Surveys were anonymous and the highest level of care was taken to preserve privacy as well as data integrity. Student responses to VR were strongly positive.\nSurvey responses regarding engagement with the VR simulations (sims) were high, with 60% of students reporting that sims were “highly” or “somewhat” engaging. Only 3% of survey respondents reported lower engagement. Respondents also reported high ease of use for VR sims, with 77% saying that using VR headsets was easy and 70% of the students saying that following VR instructions was easy.\nStudents reported being highly satisfied with their VR career exploration experiences — 76% reporting high satisfaction (versus 17% neutral, 7% negative), making the satisfaction score significantly positive (t(26) = 8.83, p ≈ 0.00). Use of VR was also reported to have had an influence on student interest in various jobs, with 66% of the students reporting that sims had affected their interest in various jobs (versus 28% neutral and 7% negative; t(28) = 5.30, p ≈ 0.00)."

  "text": "Electrical Construction Training Program Delivers Hope\nJack Cieslak \nMarch 1, 2024 \nShare this story\nThe core Transfr mission can be summed up simply as “helping people from pools of undiscovered talent get on their pathways to well-paying jobs in high-growth industries.” The hundreds of simulations in our library are focused on job sectors with positive outlooks, where people can secure entry-level positions without four-year degrees and start earning money on upwardly mobile trajectories.\nHowever, building best-in-class simulations is only one way we’re helping change lives. The team at Transfr is also ceaselessly engaged in connecting different organizations (clients and non) into virtuous networks of educators, service providers, nonprofits, and other community organizations, as well as employers, to help students and job seekers get the skills and support they need to succeed.\nElectrical construction is a vital career with great long-term potential for workers, but many job seekers don’t know how they can get started. Amanda Longtain, an anti-poverty expert with almost two decades of experience and currently Director of Program Strategy at Transfr, has been instrumental in helping create our Electrical Construction Rapid Training (ECRT) Program, which was launched in 2023 with Workforce Solutions of West Central Texas (WSWTC) as a pilot program. She joined us on Upward, the Transfr Podcast to discuss it.\n“I design anti-poverty programs for Transfr by either scaffolding our technology into existing curricula or designing programs from the ground up,” Amanda explains. “It’s a lot about ensuring that all of our learners feel a sense of belonging and get the highest quality learning experience possible.”\nThe challenge: Increasing awareness, overcoming barriers\nOne of the first challenges to helping people take advantage of the opportunities present in any job market is awareness: People simply don’t know what jobs are out there or how to train for them. Many job seekers think that their path to a higher-income job in a high-growth field is a four-year college degree. Career exploration efforts in K12 settings and workforce development boards are changing those perceptions, but even as more people set their sights on jobs in the trades, pathways can still seem opaque or too long and involved to be worth starting.\nBecoming a full-fledged electrician takes years in most states, but the right training program (with a web of other supports) can help job seekers get started on their apprenticeship journey more quickly. Amanda and the team leveraged the industry-leading Electrical Construction VR sims that Transfr and TRIO Electric built to pilot the ECRT program at WSWCT. The program gives job seekers skills training and a wide variety of support so they get not only essential skills but also assistance overcoming other life challenges. Upon completion of the program, participants are connected with employers to help them get started on their career paths.\n“One of the things that I am most excited about right now is the recognition of short-term training programs,” Amanda explains. “At Transfr, we call them rapid training programs: free-standing turnkey programs that use of hybrid learning, VR, etc. They can be set up at a library, Workforce Development Board, or night school. The end goal is getting people employed.”\nCombining VR training with wraparound services\nStreamlining training is only one part of helping people go from job seekers to skilled workers. There’s no such thing as an “average” job seeker — everyone has a variety of challenges that they need to overcome to get trained, secure a job, and be successful. What makes the ECRT program (and others like it) so revolutionary, is that it combines fast, efficient educational programming with the ability to secure industry-recognized credentials as well as a suite of support services and employment help.\n“The speed is another part of the short-term training piece that’s exciting,” Amanda explains. “Not only are you going to have a high-quality learning experience, but you’re also going to get a credential and we’re going to help you secure a job, which generates more hope and a sense of belonging. We’re also going to do it fast, which is important for adults!”\nWhat’s also important to adult learners with a variety of challenges is connecting with services to help them cover all their responsibilities while completing the program. The ECRT program provides participants with transportation and childcare vouchers as well as ongoing support to complete the program and get placed with employers.\nCreating a future with increased prosperity — and hope\nThe end goal of any adult skills training program is to help people get into well-paying jobs. The ECRT program culminates with connecting participants to local employers. Various job preparation activities and the use of VR help users feel ready for the rigors of the workplace and having portable industry credentials is a valuable addition to their resumes.\nSupport and services are vital to helping job seekers and students of any age successfully navigate their career training pathways. Connections to employers who understand what participants are learning in the program also often lead directly to securing a job, further streamlining the process, and helping participants see results faster!\nThis improved pathway from job seeker to employed person not only helps people accomplish their goals of self-sufficiency and gainful employment, it also gives them hope for the future, something which is incredibly valuable. As Amanda puts it:\n“Learning gives people hope. It’s hard to measure, but it’s literally what pushes us forward to take the next step.”\nListen to the entire EC Rapid Training podcast episode.\nWant to learn more about the EC Rapid Training Program?\nJack Cieslak \nJack Cieslak is the Editorial Director at Transfr.

Participants were grouped into three experience categories*: Having never performed an oil change (novice), having performed oil changes up to nine times (intermediate), or having performed more than 10 oil changes (experienced). Then they were assigned into one of three conditions: No training, video training (where they were shown a video playthrough of the Transfr VR simulation), or VR training (where they actively engaged in the Oil Change simulation via their headset). \nThe key takeaway was that, for novices, while viewing the video was beneficial in terms of learning (vs the group of novices who received no training), learning gains from actively engaging with the simulation were statistically greater. \nWith VR training, novices performed at levels statistically similar to intermediate participants with video training and significantly greater than intermediate participants with no “refresher” training.\n*All participants were grouped according to self-reported information."

To compare learning gains from ChatGPT-generated content to VR sims, Transfr conducted a study with 24 community members in the Louisville, KY area. Each participant learned two construction and manufacturing tasks (multimeter voltage reading and fire extinguisher usage). Participants were randomly selected to learn one task via VR sim and the other by studying a webpage* with ChatGPT-generated content. Participants had little to no prior experience performing either task. Participants returned 1-7 days after training to attempt the tasks using real tools and materials. Playing a sim led to significantly better real-world performance than studying a webpage**. After controlling for individual differences, the likelihood that a person scored higher after sim play than after webpage study was 74.5%. Participants also reported significantly more mind wandering when studying webpages than when playing sims***.\nParticipants reported extremely high engagement with VR as well as enjoyment, enthusiasm for future VR learning, and willingness to replay the specific simulations used in the test. Participants enjoyed playing sims significantly more than studying webpages*, felt significantly more engaged when playing sims than studying webpages**, and were significantly more enthusiastic about using sims for future learning versus studying webpages***. A much larger percentage of participants were willing to replay a sim versus restudy a webpage with 83% of participants saying they would replay the sim compared to only 13% of participants who would study the webpage again."

  "text": "Transfr’s XR Futures Event Reveals Future of Training\nThe atmosphere was electric as the Transfr team and a wide array of luminaries from the worlds of education and industry assembled in New York City’s Rockefeller Center for Transfr’s XR Futures. A full day of deep discussions around VR, AR, and the evolution of education in a variety of settings (academic, corrections, community organizations. etc.) followed. \n\nThe goal: Train the future of as many industries as possible and help people from pools of undiscovered talent find their personal pathways into well-paying jobs in high-growth industries.\n“Our customers and partners do amazing work to get people on a pathway to upward mobility..,” said Bharani Rajakumar, Transfr founder and CEO. “I’m excited for everyone to see and hear how our customers are driving innovative models in learning and development by leveraging Transfr’s platform.”\n\nThe day kicked off with a panel of Transfr leaders sharing the latest internal developments, both technologically and content-wise. The rest of the day’s lineup included tech announcements and demos, discussions of non-degree career paths, as well as the impact of VR training and community support on justice-impacted persons. In a standout session, Ali Zamiri and Steve Lukas of Qualcomm and Vishal Shah of Lenovo joined Bharani on stage to detail our tech partnership.\n\nTransfr thought leaders present a vision of XR training\nTransfr is leading the way in the world of VR training. The opening panel ran the gamut of Transfr product advancements, from the 50+ skills training simulations produced in 2023, including a new diesel training module and healthcare simulations, as well as updates to our immersive career exploration product.\n“Our new career exploration simulations are shorter and get right to the heart of every occupation,” said Shelley Hu, Executive Producer at Transfr. “They are also more viscerally engaging, giving users that ‘ah-ha!’ moment that can help them make more informed career decisions.”\nEngaging Transfr videos splashed on huge screens, giving attendees an inside look into exactly how these simulations play and the impact they can have on learners and job seekers. Bryant Harrison, Director of Product Development at Transfr, also took the stage to debut our more diverse array of virtual coaches and announce the upcoming release of Spanish-language career exploration in 2024.\nDr. Yun Jin Rho, Transfr’s Director of Educational Data Science, was also on hand to discuss the robust efficacy studies that Transfr has been conducting over the past year:\n“Our studies show that VR is an effective learning tool,” Yun Jin explained, accompanied by detailed slides. “A single run through a Transfr VR simulation shows better outcomes than traditional classroom learning. We also saw a 60% reduction in distractions when using VR and higher engagement versus a traditional classroom.”\nTransfr VP of Engineering, Evan Harper, also unveiled the Transfr Software Development Kit (SDK) which kicked off in closed beta that morning.\n“We’re extending a special invitation to the most talented designers out there to help us shape the future of VR training.” Evan explained. “And we’re dedicated to supporting these creators through our Partner Development Fund.”\n\nTomorrow’s careers: Beyond the four-year path\nOne of the core tenets of the Transfr mission is helping people find their unique pathways to a better future, without necessarily going along a typical four-year college pathway. More and more organizations are seeing the value in this approach, and we brought on a panel of educators and industry partners to discuss how attitudes towards the four-year path are changing and the role of technology in building the workforce of the future.\nTransfr’s Cody Waits sat down with Jamal Jessie, a workforce development manager for Georgia Power in Atlanta and Brian Bigelow, a marine manufacturing instructor with Arkansas State University, Mountain Home, to discuss the rise of alternate career paths that don’t require a four-year degree.\n“About 60% of jobs coming to Georgia in the next 10 years don’t require four year degrees,” says Jamal. “We’re trying to educate students about the fact that these opportunities are here. We’re trying to work with underserved communities… We’ve leveraged VR from Transfr because we’re trying to make it cool.”\nThis article lets you dig deeper into our amazing VR success story client panels.\n\nSecond chances for career success\nPreventing recidivism and maintaining employment among people leaving incarceration are the top goals — and biggest challenges — for reentry programs around the country. Giving justice-impacted people work skills and relevant experience are key parts of solving this problem. Transfr is proud to work with numerous organizations who are teaming up to give people reentering their communities skills and experience via VR sims, plus a comprehensive network of support services.\nGoodwill of Mississippi is just one Transfr client working with people exiting incarceration, helping them build the skills and confidence they need to secure employment and stay employed. Vicki Burton, VP of Workforce Development for Goodwill of Mississippi, had this to say:\n“We took a holistic approach towards what formerly-incarcerated individuals need to be able to go to work. One thing they need is to understand what the world of work is like today. You may have been a master mechanic when you went into the system. But vehicles have changed. Tools have changed… From there, we take it into digital skills training. Getting these individuals to embrace this technology is the easy part. They love it!”\nMeanwhile, Allen County Juvenile Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana, leverages VR from Transfr to give youths a look at the career paths available to them and the skills they need to pursue these jobs. A web of local groups (including the Boys&Girls Club of Fort Wayne) combine to provide services and support to these justice-impacted youths helping them find the hope and motivation they need to succeed back in their communities.\n“Mindset is really critical. If you can change the mindset of a child, then you’ve done your job. And that’s what Boys and Girls clubs is all about is changing mindset. And it’s so awesome to have this partnership would Transfr because it literally, literally takes the mind of a child into the workplace.”\n\nTraining tomorrow’s workforce, today\nTransfr’s clients are as diverse as the communities they serve! Across the country and at every level — statewide, hyper-local, K12, community college, employers, and more — these hard working teams are doing everything they can to help students, the formerly incarcerated, and job seekers of all kinds get on their own personal career paths. It’s a huge challenge, but with the right experience, technology, and collaboration, it’s possible.\n“Every time we talk with our clients,” Bharani says. “We make more and more connections between organizations, sharing skills and ideas, inspiring one another, and ultimately forging the kind of networks that will help more people get on their own pathways to prosperity.”\nWant to read more about the Transfr SDK?"

  "text": "Virtual reality training offers students a glimpse into career paths\nKaitlyn Alderman, state workforce manager for Transfr Inc., delivered a presentation on the power of virtual reality as a tool for career exploration and training during a recent meeting of the Kiwanis Club of Anniston.\nAlderman, who has been with Transfr for over three years, highlighted how the company’s VR platform helps students gain hands-on experience in high-demand fields like manufacturing, healthcare, aviation and hospitality.\n“We want to try to reach students where they are, which is often through technology,” Alderman told Kiwanis members on Feb. 6. “Transfr began in 2017 with a focus on manufacturing training, but we’ve expanded to offer career exploration in several fields. Our goal is to help students find career paths they’re interested in before they graduate.”\nThe VR simulations, which range from electrical safety training to precision measurement and even restaurant management, allow students to experience real-world tasks in a safe, controlled environment. This hands-on approach not only enhances students’ skills but also builds their confidence. Alderman shared an example of how aspiring electrical linemen can virtually scale heights and perform tasks, without the risk that comes with the real-world job.\n“Being a lineman can be very dangerous, and if you’re a student who thinks they may want to be a lineman but don’t know if you’re afraid of heights, VR provides the chance to try it out without any liability issues,” Alderman said. “It gives students the opportunity to see what the job really feels like before making any decisions.”\nDuring the presentation, attendees were invited to witness a live demonstration of the VR platform, where Sarah Woolmaker, assistant director of the Anniston Museum and Gardens, volunteered to try out the restaurant manager simulation. The virtual experience not only tested her leadership and decision-making skills but also gave her a taste of the complexities of managing a restaurant.\n“These simulations can be very detailed,” Alderman said. “In some, students perform tasks like surgery, where they can see blood splatter as they use a bone saw. Other simulations, like an oil change, are incredibly realistic, with step-by-step instructions on how to perform the task safely.”\nAlderman said Transfr’s platform is designed to complement traditional classroom learning, making it especially beneficial for kinesthetic learners. The integration of VR has been shown to improve student outcomes, as it allows them to apply their knowledge in practical scenarios.\n“Students tend to score higher on assessments when VR is incorporated with traditional learning,” Alderman said. “When you’re told to do something while actually doing it, that muscle memory and hands-on practice help cement the information.”\nIn addition to supporting career exploration, Transfr offers data tracking for both educators and employers, allowing them to monitor a learner’s progress and identify areas where additional training may be needed.\n“This technology is a great tool for teachers and employers,” Alderman said. “For example, if an employer is training a group of new hires, they can use the system to see if any of the employees are struggling with certain tasks, and they can intervene before the issue becomes a bigger problem.”\nFor more information on Transfr’s virtual reality training programs, visit transfrinc.com.\nThis article was originally published on The Anniston Star as Virtual reality training offers students a glimpse into career paths"

  "text": "The Role Technology Plays in Deeper Learning Strategies\nIf the goal today is to help all learners, not just select few, and to reach and demonstrate mastery and deep learning, then where should our focus be? Within the Illinois Eastern Community Colleges’ (IECC’s) four-campus system, we have integrated standardized resources and tools that cater to individual needs, from English as a second language (ESL) to adult basic education (ABE), GED® readiness content and career pathways solutions, and we are still seeing a need to remedy systemic barriers. In this reflection piece, I will share with you the tools our organization has integrated, our online resources and the various platforms we utilize. Through continued research and implementation, we have improved learner preparation and emboldened them to take the next step. When inviting new technology, we empower the most important learning resource—our teachers.\nThe IECC adult education students are nontraditional learners living in rural areas with low- to middle-class socioeconomic status. In 2020, the college was tasked with finding immediate solutions to student engagement, connection and continual academic support. The technology incorporated was not only meant to enhance curriculum provided in the classroom but to equitably deliver content. Fast forward to today, some of our classrooms remain stuck with incorporated tools seen as a substitution and not as a deeper learning resource. Changing the mindsets of instructors and students has proven difficult. How could we use our new online resources and digital technologies to enhance learners’ experiences and ultimately take them from just getting by in their GED journey to expanding the skills they need for new career pathways and life applications? \n“Imagine that you wish to visit a friend twenty miles away. You could walk (some people would prefer to do so). But it would be much easier to use a bicycle, and it would be far easier still to use a car” (Dede, 2014). Teachers, given the right tools and vehicles, can approach deeper learning instructional strategies and methods far easier than those who choose it without technology. The tools we have incorporated into our ABE/ASE classrooms and ESL courses provide students with the opportunity to expand their horizons beyond the classroom. Incorporating the college’s LMS, Canvas and Google learning environment brought to life new ways to engage, organize and communicate. Innovative classroom tools such as virtual reality headsets and curriculum and our exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools brought enhanced learning experiences. As a grant-funded program, finding free online resources, learning tools and standard-aligned curriculum for adult education was vital to learner and program success.\nEquitable Solutions for Teaching Methods in the Classroom and Beyond\n“Academic knowledge and skills alone won’t enable students to successfully navigate a rapidly changing world … Students must be able to communicate their ideas effectively, think creatively, work collaboratively to solve problems, and manage their own learning” (AIR, 2016). “The technology is just a tool, one that can empower people to change the ways in which education is structured and delivered” (Dede, 2014). When focusing on the learner’s diverse needs, experiences and backgrounds, customization provides a more impactful learning experience, which students desperately need. \nEven though the pandemic brought the world to a standstill, it paved the way for open-mindedness, awareness and a willingness to embrace change. The IECC Adult Education program opened the door to new technology and software through the help of the Illinois Digital Learning Lab. The focus was on providing equitable access to level-aligned online curricula, easily accessible technology tools and innovative ideas and processes. As part of the initial phase to digital equitability, we set goals to meet web-accessibility standards and expand digital accessibility by determining how best to support all students as they transition to college.\nPartnering with the Local Workforce Innovation Board\nThrough the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) program, IECC students were given opportunities in several local career pathways, all of which encouraged growth in digital literacy. Students can be trained through an Integrated Career and Academic Preparation System of Illinois (ICAPS) program that provides integrated education and training experience and promotes a quality instructional framework, as defined by WIOA. “ICAPS provides an accelerated pathway to an industry-recognized credential through training partnerships–such as Career and Technical Education or an approved training provider…” (icapsillinois.com, 2023). During the pandemic, much of what an Integrated Education and Training program provided in the way of experience introduced the need for virtual and augmented reality, hands-on experiences. With the help of the Illinois Digital Learning Lab (IDLL) cohort, the IECC Adult Education program was able to continue pursuing the full ICAPS experience for their learners.\nCultivate Classroom Culture with Creativity\nWith the avalanche of new technologies and new ways of working, jobseekers need to become more creative to thrive amidst change. Design programs such as Adobe, Canva, AI and virtual reality help build students’ creative and digital skills to position them for the workforce. “Overwhelmingly, 95% of educators said that fostering creativity leads to better mental health and less stress for themselves and students alike” (Johnsrud, 2023). Introducing a creative activity early on sets the stage for a learning culture committed to self-expression and well-being. Colleges across the country are embracing creative and innovative strategies to help students successfully transition from their studies to a career.\nRethinking the College to Career Transition\nCollege graduates can no longer rely on the degree alone to accurately define job qualification. Now colleges are pursuing innovative strategies, including integrating career education into the curriculum, connecting students with career networks and ensuring equitable access to internships. IECC was introduced to NorthStar Digital Literacy in 2020, with NorthStar offering a set of digital literacy and technology skills assessments to help instructors determine student readiness for online navigation and usage. Not only does NorthStar prepare teachers to provide the best instruction methods for each student, but this resource also provides the student with an opportunity to grow in digital knowledge and earn digital badges that can put on their resume or in employment applications to display the skills they already have.\nThe Importance of Introducing AI Digital Skills for Workplace Preparedness\nIt is paramount that educators empower the future workforce for an AI experience by supporting digital literacy and becoming AI-ready. 70% of employees are expected to heavily use data by 2025. 62% of employees say generative AI will require a new set of skills at work (Hughes, 2023).\nIn the past six months, how often has AI come up in conversation at your organization? This new level of access has sparked many conversations about its benefits and risks, ranging from how AI will transform jobs, education and our daily lives. While it is often unseen, it is everywhere in our society. And it is revolutionizing what is possible for learning and teaching (COABE, 2023).\nBy exploring new artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard while learning how to use AI to save time and create a more accessible and impactful learning experience for adults, AI becomes understandable and ethical for education purposes. “College’s ought to prepare their students for the future, and AI literacy will certainly be important in ours,” says Owen Terry, a Columbia University student and author of “I’m a student. You Have No Idea How Much We’re Using ChatGPT.” It is time for us to leverage AI activities for adult learners through inviting project-based learning and work with actionable plans for utilizing AI.\nBuilding a Classroom-to-Career Pipeline\n“Unexpected events like a pandemic and the simultaneous development of technology can help trigger a new VR-based education revolution… The VR environment is an essential part of the modern educational process… Moreover, it allows transforming practical experience into valuable knowledge and skills, which is especially important and appreciated in the industry” (Paskiewicz, A., Salach, M., Dymora, P., et. al. 2021).\nTaking VR to the next level, the IECC Adult Education team brought Transfr VR to the table. Transfr VR is a virtual reality resource that opened new opportunities for students by creating unique pathways to high-demand jobs. Facilitated by immersive, hands-on training, students began their journey by exploring, then acquired skills to start their career experience. The virtual career exploration simulations offered the opportunity to try several careers. Within Transfr VR, students attained hands-on simulation training, giving the IECC adult education learner an edge over others, entering the workforce after graduation with knowledge and experience.\nTransfr VR brings immersive hands-on skills applications for career pathways that cover the 16 career clusters the Illinois Community College Board requires we address within adult education programs across the state of Illinois.\n“Nearly half of the trainees scored at or above 90% on the real-world transfer test with no prior human coaching or hands-on experience with the tools” (Transfr, 2023). By bringing a company’s training facility to the college, students are equipped to do the job before they get it, building a classroom-to-career pipeline.\nConclusion: Integrating Foundational Adult Education into Career Pathways Using Technology\nThe supplemental resources we continue to integrate, including our core curriculum, provide interactive activities and lessons to compete with our peers. As students dive further into digital literacy awareness and begin to understand the value of using it for real-world purposes, they will start to take ownership of what they are learning and how they use the skills they are gaining. \n“Academic knowledge and skills alone won’t enable students to successfully navigate a rapidly changing world, participate in a complex and increasingly diverse democracy, or engage fully in the ever evolving 21st century workplace” (AIR, 2016). We are working toward supportive, active learning by expanding options for all learners. We believe this starts with aggregating free and open education resources from a variety of sources and aligning them with the core academic competencies adult learners need for college and career readiness.\nIn integrating technology over the past couple of years, the goal was to provide an educational solution for all learners. What we didn’t realize was that we could use technology to promote resilience and help our students conquer anxiety pertaining to the digital world. With careful selection of level-appropriate online programs and the right tools and methods to perform, learners can apply these resources to build academic skills and transfer them to professionalism.\nThis article was originally published on Evolllution as The Role Technology Plays in Deeper Learning Strategies"

  "text": "Find your next career at GST Michigan Works in Bad Axe\nVideo games can help you get a job.\nWell, kind of. \nThe GST Michigan Works Bad Axe service center is hosting an event where people can explore different careers through virtual reality. \nThe Bad Axe service center started hosting these simulation opportunities last year. \nThere are approximately 20 plus career opportunities for people to choose from in the simulation. \n“I think we’re finding that the more opportunities that we have to give people that tactile experience and show them what occupations are like,” said GST Michigan Works Chief Services Officer Jessica Billiau. “It helps them to make the decisions on their next career step, whether that’s training or going right to employment.”\nThe equipment used are leased headsets from Transfr Inc., “a company that uses virtual reality training to help people find well-paying careers in high-demand fields.” \nBilliau talked about how the service provider stumbled upon the VR career opportunity when it learned about it from another Michigan Works agency. \n“We were first introduced from another Michigan Works agency that was utilizing them in one of their youth programs,” Billiau said. “They told us that it was really cool and very impactful for the programs that they had. When we went to our annual conference, the Transf Inc. folks were there, and they gave a presentation and we kind of just went from there. It’s been highly successful for us, particularly with our young people when we go to career fairs and things like that, but adults like them too.” \nOne career example that is in the simulation for people to try is that of linemen. \n“I have been surprised in talking with some of the tree trimming companies that we work with where people will apply for a position, then kind of think about it later and it turns out they really don’t like heights,” Billiau said. “One of the things that we have heard continuously on the simulation for the lineman is that it does a very good job of simulating really what it looks like when you’re up in a bucket truck.\n“So whether that’s for tree trimming or electric line repair, it kind of gives that realistic feel in an opportunity that you might not otherwise get in person. Everybody can’t go out on a career exploration, or a talent tour somewhere and actually get up in a bucket truck and see what that’s like.” \nAt GST Michigan’s Flint location, they took the virtual reality opportunity to another level. This time simulation meets reality. \n“Another popular one is the construction trades,” Billiau said. “We actually did a pilot program. This was down in our Flint location, but we piloted an early construction trades workshop. The training was E-learning, so it was virtual for a couple of weeks. Then those individuals that were really into it had the opportunity to then transition into a live work experience with a local employer. From there, once that work experience was over, they could determine if they wanted to go on to do additional training for construction trades or in some cases, maybe go right to work and start an apprenticeship.” \nGST Michigan Works plans to use this technological opportunity in their UM-FERN project, a collaborative effort with UM-Flint School of Nursing and Thumb Community Health Partnership. \n“There’s a lot of attention that’s being focused on the idea of making sure that we’re supporting those individuals that are coming from our area that we want to return and to take some of the nursing positions,” Billiau said. “Some of the challenges with that can be the lack of sites where people can do their clinicals and that sort of thing.\n“What we see a lot of times, with nursing specifically, we’ll meet people that have been doing a certified nurse aid position for a while or a medical assistant or some other part of health care. Now they’re ready to advance their career and go after being an RN. That can be challenging when you’re working on a bachelor’s degree, and you have a full-time job. So we kind of come alongside our partners to try to support that so we can see people advance in their career pathways.” \nThis article was originally published on Huron Daily Tribune as Find your next career at GST Michigan Works in Bad Axe"

  "text": "Clients Highlight Successes at Transfr’s XR Futures\nTransfr’s XR Futures saw instructors and experts from a variety of organizations take the stage to delve into how they’re shaping the workforce of tomorrow. In panel after panel, these dedicated educators and other leaders took our audience through their programs, their successes, and their visions for the future.\n“We’re on a mission to help people from diverse pools of undiscovered talent,” said Transfr founder and CEO Bharani Rajakumar. “Find their unique pathways into well-paying careers with upward mobility.”\nThe guests at XR Futures share that mission. Educators and industry experts discussed the shift towards training programs outside the four-year path, how workforce boards are using VR, and the types of comprehensive support programs that help people succeed after incarceration.\nEducation and industry partners tout non-degree careers\nHere at Transfr, we’re always talking about helping people find their unique pathways to a better future — often times without a four-year college degree. More and more organizations are seeing the value in this approach and we brought on a panel of educators and industry partners to discuss how attitudes towards the four-year college degrees are changing and the role of technology in building the workforce of the future.\nAtlanta-based Georgia Power is leading the way in developing the non-degree workforce by leveraging Transfr’s innovative career exploration simulations. They’ve helped 1,500 participants explore 3,000+ simulations, giving them insights into countless career paths. They also collaborated with Transfr on the Lineworker career exploration sim, ensuring that it would accurately reflect a day in the life of that role.\n“Kids are really excited to get their hands on the VR headsets and explore all the different career options out there,” said Jamal Jessie, a workforce development manager with Georgia Power. “We also worked with the Transfr team to build a highly accurate Lineworker simulation to give students a look at what it’s like to do this job.”\nAnother well-paying job outside the four-year track that many students and job seekers might not be considering is boat building. Brian Bigelow, a marine manufacturing instructor at Arkansas State University, Mountain Home, leverages existing Transfr VR sims to teach essential manufacturing skills. Simulations give students the repetitions they need to master techniques they’ll use in the workplace and also augment Brian’s bandwidth as a teacher:\n“Using VR in the classroom is such a game changer for me,” says Brian. “I can have a couple students using our in-class paint booth and equipment and the rest can be in headsets, practicing in the virtual environment.”\nBrian was floored by the detail in previous Transfr simulations. He’s also collaborated with designers who are leveraging Transfr’s advanced SDK to build new industry-leading boat-building sims that will provide even more valuable training and job opportunities in this field.\n“It’s amazing the level of detail they’ve captured.” Brian says. “I’m intimately familiar with the manufacturing setting we modeled them after — you put on the headset, and it’s like you’re there.”\nWorkforce boards use cutting-edge sims to train for high-demand roles\nFor many people, the pathway towards a new role or career starts at a local workforce board. The hard-working teams at these offices are charged with helping job seekers of all kinds (recently unemployed, new-to-the-workforce, and students) find the right job to suit their skills and interests.\nOne state org that’s leading the way in building the workforce of the future is AIDT (Alabama Industrial Development Training). Their offices provide bespoke, no-cost training services designed to meet the needs of businesses and citizens across the state.\n“My division is responsible for curriculum development and training,” explains Bobby John Drinkard, Assistant Director, Central Alabama at AIDT. “And virtual reality was one of the things that we wanted to focus on… We were looking for a customizable solution. We met with Bharani and the team and they were very amenable to what we wanted. They were very flexible and very willing to work with us instead of giving us something canned off the shelf.”\nThis tailored approach has supercharged the career journeys of over 1,350 individuals who’ve completed nearly 18,000 simulations — with over 1,000 securing careers with prestigious companies like Lockheed and Mercedes.\n“There were hurdles that we had to overcome,” says Jacqueline Allen, Assistant Director, Communications & External Affairs at AIDT. “But once we got the Lockheed Martin pilot program going — and they had a diverse population work with it — that really helped to sell the use of VR. We were rocking and rolling after that point.”\nDriving change for justice-impacted persons with VR and more\nJustice systems around the USA and the world struggle with countless issues, chief among them recidivism and maintaining employment with people who have recently left incarceration. Building work skills and relevant experience is a vital component to helping justice-impacted people build new lives with upward mobility.\nIn Fort Wayne, Indiana, a network of local organizations (including the Boys&Girls Club Indiana Alliance and the Allen County Juvenile Center) have teamed up to offer services and support to justice-impacted individuals, helping them find something else that’s key to a successful life outside of incarceration: Hope.\nThe relationship with Transfr has been transformational for my organization,” says Joe Jordan, President and CEO, Boys & Girls Clubs of Northeast Indiana. “Transfr has helped us expose kids to different career paths and help them figure out what pathway they want. It’s been totally transformative for us.”\nHaving a robust array of support services is vital to helping the previously incarcerated build new lives. Teamwork Englewood, a nonprofit on the south side of Chicago serving formerly incarcerated people, combined Transfr VR learning products with a suite of services, including bus cards and a stipend, to ensure the highest chance of success for program participants.\n“We found that people were returning to their communities, getting jobs, and just walking off,” says Mark Mitchell, Associate Director of Teamwork Englewood. “With VR from Transfr, we’re able to give participants relevant skills and experience that has demonstrably improved their success in staying employed.”\nPartners in success building a brighter future\nBuilding tomorrow’s workforce is a tall order, but neither Transfr nor our rapidly-growing number of partners is going it alone. Every successful program is part of a vast network of groups and services — educators, workforce boards, community organizations, industry partners, and more — who join forces to help job seekers and students find the right careers for them and get on a pathway to upward mobility.\n“Events like this serve as a powerful demonstration of the amazing work that Transfr clients across the country are doing,” said Bharani. “They’re also a reminder that none of us can do this all on our own. We need to work together, and that’s what we’re doing.”\nWant to read more about Transfr’s solutions and use cases?"

Topic tracks for 2023 include accessibility and inclusion, emerging tech, equity and justice, and many other focus areas that are top of mind for educators and policymakers.\nAlso on the program this year: Transfr! CEO Bharani Rajakumar was on site for Transfr’s panel Will the Metaverse Disrupt Equity Gaps? We had a chance to talk to other leaders in the training and workforce development worlds about the ways in which VR can broaden opportunities for everyone and help people from pools of undiscovered talent get into well-paying jobs in high-demand industries.\n“We’re focused on career exploration,” Bharani explained on stage with panel members from River Parishes Community College and Morehouse College/Metaverse United LLC. “People can put on the headset and experience a variety of occupations and truly see themselves in those roles. We’re trying to help people from pools of undiscovered talent who’ve been operating outside of the educational system.”\nEven when we weren’t on stage, the Transfr buzz was out there. During her session “Investor Talk: Skills, Employability & Pathways,” Kate Ballinger of Firework Ventures had this to say: “What Transfr does is use VR technology to help students at scale, to help high school students envision what a certain career could look like, to help college students train for these jobs and get into a career with upward mobility. When it comes to emerging technologies like VR and AI, we need to look for places where they have unique applications.”\nBut it’s not all about us! Three vital trends we saw on the floor at SXSW EDU include emerging technologies and innovations, serving diverse learners, and building the workforce of tomorrow.\nLet’s jump into these dynamic topics!\nEmpowering educators and learners with AI\nUsing AI in education is a topic that’s very near and dear to our hearts here at Transfr. Our AI coach Simon has helped countless students progress through a wide array of sims. Having an AI coach empowers students and educators in a number of important ways: The AI coach never tires, misses details, or gets upset with students. \nWe’ve heard from instructors in the field that students with behavioral issues, when they realized that they can’t get a reaction from the AI instructor, actually change their behavior and focus on the simulation, often to surprising and positive results!\nHaving this extra set of AI eyes on students doing individual VR practice is a huge benefit for instructors: Instead of splitting focus between a class full of students, the instructor can trust the AI coach to give each student customized feedback, based on their unique performance in the simulations. \nOther innovators are also seeking to use AI in teaching and learning as well. In the panel “Myth Busting: AI’s Role in Teaching & Learning,” the panel discussed using AI to help reduce the administrative load on busy instructors. Assistance from AI systems can be used to deliver aggregated insights on student performance — which is something we also do with our Transfr Dashboard to give users a detailed look at how their trainees are progressing through the sims.\nDriving increased equity in education with technology\nWhen you do a panel called “Will the Metaverse Disrupt Equity Gaps,” you know equality and improving outcomes is top of mind. VR learning offers unique opportunities for learners to practice new skills in a safe environment, free from the prying eyes of their peers. This can open the door for students to pursue careers they might otherwise have avoided. It also lets them safely make mistakes without worrying about the reactions of other students.\nThe panel “Serving Adult Learners: An Equity Imperative” focused on how colleges are working to reorient themselves to serve adult learners with more diversity across age, race, income, and professions. At Transfr, we know that one size doesn’t fit every learner when it comes to building the skills that will take somewhere from where they are — just entering college as a youth or doing a late-in-life career change — into a well-paying career in a high-growth industry.\nIntegrating VR career exploration into job search efforts at workforce boards and colleges can help adults find new career paths they might not otherwise have considered. VR training can help learners progress on those pathways more quickly and efficiently than they might otherwise!\nBuilding the workforce of tomorrow\nBuilding the workforce of tomorrow is what Transfr is all about, so it was awesome to see so many panels tackling this broad, vital topic. In “The Power of Together: Solving the Skills Gap,” a panel of different DC-area colleges talked about the power of collaboration — since no one school can be all things to all its students. This is part of our ethos of cooperation here at Transfr, as we spend a lot of time building bridges between different organizations to put VR technology in the hands of everyone who can use it, then connect learners with job opportunities at local employers who need their help!\nWe already mentioned Kate Ballinger’s shoutout during “Investor Talk: Skills, Employability & Pathways,” but it’s heartening to see people highlighting career pathways and skills, vs solely focusing on four-year colleges (which we know not everyone will go to). This point was driven home in “How to Invest in Tomorrow’s Labor Market,” where panelists discussed how the present labor market had called into question the value of a traditional college degree. Would-be employers need to open their eyes to the potential that late-in-life career switchers and even previously-incarcerated people can bring to their operations.\nA bold new world of tech and education\nEvery year, the world of education changes in unexpected and unpredictable ways. However, what doesn’t change is the commitment of educators of all kinds to help their students be their best and accomplish great things. We constantly see a world that fears technological integration but we also have to consider how technology has the capability to help, enable, and advocate for human learning and the future of work. Technology will play a big part of the formula for success that students, educators, and administrators need to grapple with in order to help every student get on their personal pathway to prosperity and upward mobility.\nHaving had an amazing time at SXSW EDU, we’re filled with hope for the future and all the potential that’s out there waiting to be realized!"

  "text": "Boys&Girls Clubs, STEM Careers & More\nAt Transfr, we’re a collection of doers. We’re focused on creating best-in-class simulations to train the future of every industry as well as building the relationships between educators, workforce development orgs, community groups, and employers that will help job seekers get into well-paying careers in high-growth industries. All that doesn’t mean we’re too busy to share a bit of good news when it comes our way — especially when it’s about us!\nIn the first of these recurring news roundups, we look at stories about our recent electrical construction sim releases, the Indiana Boys&Girls Club using VR career exploration, and students getting excited about STEM! Dig in and definitely check out our News section for the latest reporting on Transfr as well as original content.\n\nElectrical construction VR sims released!\nPowering the workforce of the future requires a solid foundation and a dedicated team. With high-growth industries struggling to keep up with the demands to find skilled workers, it’s become increasingly important to create the right training pathways for workers, bringing together skills and demand. The National Electrical Contractors Association reports that the demand for new electricians will grow by 9% through 2030). With a median annual income of $60,000, that puts workers on a well-paying career path without racking up unmanageable debt.\nIn order to help more people embrace this amazing opportunity, Transfr partnered with Houston, TX’s TRIO Electric to release a collection of Electrical Construction simulations. Putting people on their personal pathways to prosperity is key to the Transfr mission; CEO Bharani Rajakumar had this to say about the new sims:\n“To keep pace with the complex demands of the electrical industry, employers are in search of new and creative ways to develop the skilled workforce that this dynamic industry demands.”\nTRIO Electric is an electrical design, construction, and service firm and a critical partner on these new Transfr simulations — helping translate their in-house training program into VR. TRIO President and CEO, Beau Pollock, shared some of the pain points the industry was facing:\n“Finding electrical instructors is difficult and time-consuming,” Beau explains. “And training requires us to use the same materials that technicians use on the job.”\nTurning TRIO’s Electrician Training Program into virtual simulations helps trainees develop hands-on skills with the assistance of a digital coach, in a fully-immersive environment, and without using up expensive materials. Together, Transfr and TRIO are helping train tomorrow’s workforce today!\nIndiana Boys&Girls Clubs embrace VR career exploration\nDiscovering the right career for students should be exciting! The Indiana Alliance of Boys & Girls Clubs is embracing a modern twist on that sentiment by incorporating virtual reality career exploration into their programs across the state.\nWith Transfr’s career exploration simulations, Boys & Girls Club students can try their hands at putting up power lines or landing a plane. Students are also exposed to other career pathways, like healthcare and hospitality. Lana Taylor, Executive Director for the Indiana Alliance, shared that since implementation it has helped clubs reconnect with teens who fell off their radar during the first couple years of the coronavirus pandemic.\n“Just having the experience and the exposure to it has been really good, even for the little guys,” says Lana. “Because what we’re finding is you need to start early.”\nDiscovering a student’s career pathway will take exposure to an array of possibilities. Tom Darling, Director of Career Exploration and Product Market Fit at Transfr had this to say about his learnings from being in the workforce development field for two decades: \n“Few students know what they want to do when they’re exposed to traditional career-exploration programs starting in seventh or eighth grade, so the goal of the VR simulations is to help students find a path that interests them.”\nGetting excited about STEM in Texas!\nCreating opportunities to explore careers is shown to be one of the most important elements to helping students get on career paths in today’s world. Iredell Statesville schools celebrated National STEM Day with virtual reality, immersing students in Transfr’s VR career exploration simulations.\nDuring this exciting event, led by Middle School Career Development Coordinator Juli Tipton, CTE-STEM Coach Dr. Debra, and Deb Sahley from Lakeshore Elementary School, fifth grade students explored STEM-related careers via an array of simulations. Giving students deeper insights into the daily tasks of various jobs is one of the most unique and powerful features of VR career exploration."

  "text": "Shelton State Community College Embraces VR Training\nExecutive summary\nThe governor of Alabama has set an ambitious goal: Add 500,000 skilled workers to the state’s workforce to help local employers fill open roles, providing Alabamans with well-paying jobs in high-growth industries. The state’s Ready to Work programs are augmenting their classroom soft-skills and work readiness programs with technical skills delivered via Transfr’s hands-on simulations. After completing the Ready to Work program, students with the kinds of skills imparted by Transfr modules are employable and ready for on-the-job training when they step on-site. \nThe challenge: Create 500,000 skilled workers in Alabama\nThe state of Alabama is looking to create 500,000 skilled workers — that’s a big number! But workforce development teams in the Yellowhammer State aren’t sitting back and hoping for the best. Alabama has strong statewide workforce initiatives aimed at preparing their citizens for jobs in manufacturing and other high-growth, high-tech industries.\nThe Ready to Work program is open to any job seeker of any age and is mostly focused on soft skills and basic workplace knowledge. This program is building Alabama’s future workforce by empowering residents with job-readiness skills they will need to find and secure jobs, while delivering the foundational technical skills that employers look for in candidates. This technical skills training is delivered via Transfr’s virtual hands-on simulations. \nAmbitious programs like Ready to Work, which aim to modernize workforces, need a robust array of resources to be effective! For the job seekers entering the program, personal attention and mastery of fundamental skills are essential for success. Transfr was the state’s solution to delivering both at scale!\nShelton State leverages VR training to supercharge programs\nPartnering with Transfr is helping Alabaman’s learn more skills, faster, with personal attention delivered via our virtual instructor, Simon. Hands-on simulations from Transfr complement Ready to Work and JumpstartAL programs by seamlessly integrating into their curricula and delivering high-quality, repeatable trainings to their audiences, without bringing on additional staff, or the cost of expensive materials or training facility buildouts. They’re also exciting buzz-builders for the programs!\nJob seekers are already using Transfr as part of their unique pathways to better lives, with 128 students in 30 classes completing 1,833 simulations at 92% mastery! Transfr’s plant safety, precision measurement, and blueprint reading simulations are important parts of this program, making Transfr a great fit that augments classroom instruction and enhances the efforts of human instructors instead of replacing them.\n“Transfr is a great tool in helping provide a modern instructional approach to the precision measurement component of Ready to Work,” says Shelton State Ready to Work instructor Molly Wagner. “My students enjoy mastering the virtual simulations which incorporate many skills that are needed to succeed in today’s workforce. This technology keeps students of all ages engaged as they progress at their own pace and receive immediate feedback on their progress.”\n“Transfr is a great company to work with and the technology that they have developed creates stimulating real-world experiences for students. Not only are we leveraging this cutting-edge technology to create excitement for career exploration aimed at prospective students, we are also eager to work this technology into our applicable programs to create exposure to actual work environments.”\nIn addition to helping instructors do their best work and reach more Alabamans, Chris added that the technological aspect is important when it comes to engaging students who have grown up in a high-tech world:\n“Instruction must be interesting and relatable to students’ life situations. That’s what I think is special about Transfr: The VR content is valuable to the students who can explore and prepare for careers, some of which they might not even know existed.”\nShelton State — leading Alabama in jumpstarting workforce training\nShelton State’s engagement has been very high. Since starting work with Transfr in August of 2020, 128 students in 30 classes have gone through the program. Ready to Work is generally geared for smaller class sizes, giving job seekers more personal attention. The response from both students and faculty has been very positive.\n“It was very informative and accurate with hands-on demonstrations. It gives you the chance to learn at your own pace and maintain focus on the problem solving one step at a time. I would prefer this method over all other methods,” says Liz Pruitt, a Ready to Work student at Shelton State.\nThis is the Transfr ethos in action: Empowering students and instructors with the highest quality training to give people the skills they need for real jobs, right now, in high-growth industries — augmenting humans is key to the success of programs like these. Real-time data from student VR sessions is immediately available to instructors who use it to tailor classroom instruction and give customized support to students when and how they need it. \nHumans + technology build the future of Alabama\nThe promise of every stage of technological development has been to help humans do more than the impossible and help people everywhere live happier, healthier lives. In Alabama, the Jumpstart AL initiative and Ready to Work programs, augmented with Transfr hands-on simulations, are helping do just that. Human instructors give job seekers the soft skills and workplace understanding they need to find and secure employment in the growing number of high-growth jobs coming to the state. Transfr augments these programs with the hard skills training they need to learn more and earn more, preparing them to excel the first day they step onto the worksite. \n“The ability to integrate competencies that can only be gained through work experience into our entry-level training programs really streamlines the preparedness of our students” says Chris. “We are currently using this technology for training that leads to employment in the manufacturing sector, but are eager to expand the use of this technology to the healthcare sector in the future. Students love it and so do our employers. We want to leverage it any place we can.”"

  "text": "The Importance of Ethics in VR Research Studies\nAs a virtual reality (VR) company, we here at Transfr get asked questions like this all the time:\n“Is VR an effective training methodology?”\n“Can people really learn hands-on skills in VR?”\n“Does what people learn in VR stick with them when they take off the headset?”\nThese questions have been asked since VR’s inception. The short answer is “Yes!” (For a deeper understanding of why we can say that so confidently, please explore the numerous reports on our VR Efficacy Studies page, compiled from rigorous, original research that we conduct ourselves.)\nHowever, anyone can post fancy-sounding reports about the supposed effectiveness of their technology. In order for those reports to carry real weight, they must be conducted with academic rigor and an eye towards the highest ethical standards. In this article, we’ll address why ethical standards are so important when conducting research, the lengths Transfr goes to in order to protect the study participants’ and their data as it’s gathered during the studies, as well as how we analyze and process the data we collect.\nHigh ethical standards: The foundation of good data\nTransfr is a complex company — we build industry-leading training simulations, we connect organizations of all kinds to provide complex webs of services for students and job seekers, and much more — so why are we also taking the time and expense to conduct in-depth research studies? And what makes it so important to uphold the highest ethical standards when conducting this research?\nTo dig into those questions, let’s take a step back and talk about professional standards in the realm of research: All trained researchers certified by the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) program in academia are trained in the ethical principles and guidelines summarized in The Belmont Report. These guidelines are designed to protect human participants in biomedical and behavioral research. While the Transfr team may be researchers in the tech industry (instead of an academic setting) we are nonetheless called upon to protect human participants in our research — which we take very seriously.\nProtecting the privacy of our human participants and the security of their data is our ethical responsibility. It’s also a key way that we truly respect our clients (where we recruit many volunteers and conduct surveys) and our other volunteers. Users from a wide variety of different backgrounds need to be able to trust Transfr products from day one, starting with creating their accounts. Knowing how their data is being created, tracked, used, and protected is key to building this trust.\nProduct evaluation — the next step in product development\nIn one of my most formative student experiences, I had to debate the degree of responsibility a scientist should have for their inventions. Since the scientist who created the invention should understand the new creation’s capabilities more thoroughly than anyone else, I naively argued that the scientist should be held accountable for how their invention would be used.\nNow that I’m a social scientist, I see how complicated this topic can be: The products that companies like Transfr develop can be used in a wide variety of ways, so it’s not enough for us to decide that we understand how people will use them — we must constantly monitor, study, and evaluate how trainees use them and the outcomes they’re experiencing. It’s the natural next step of product development: Product evaluation.\nProduct evaluation is part of our overall effort to be responsible for our inventions and ethical stewards of this ascendant technology. As we conduct our numerous studies, we’re constantly evaluating our simulations (applying the highest ethical standards in data handling, privacy, etc.) so that we can confidently state that we understand how our products work and that we’re delivering the highest-quality training to users.\nConstant product evaluation is also a key way we improve our sims. Every researcher at Transfr takes seriously our responsibility to conduct ethical research and to inform our clients of the results.\nPeople first: The importance of participant consent and privacy\nConsent is of utmost importance in ethical research. When we invite our clients — or anyone else — to participate in our research projects, they should be able to make an informed decision by reviewing the potential benefits and risks associated with the research. The team here at Transfr conducts VR efficacy studies in the realms of education and psychology to increase our understanding of how people learn. This knowledge aids us in creating more effective tools to help people learn vital workplace skills more effectively. We follow the same guidelines that academic research organizations do, adhering to strict research standards and ethical principles to protect research participants and their privacy.\nData privacy is a chief concern in our online era and data collection is a critical part of our research processes. Therefore, we’re highly aware of our responsibility and respectful of the risks that our participants and clients take in trusting us with their data. Modern technology makes data collection very convenient, but we always bear in mind that data comes from humans. The massive sets of numbers we see on our computers didn’t come from nowhere — they were collected from real people!\nThese numbers represent people’s activities, actions, life events, and career journeys. In earlier days of scientific research, scientists needed to collect data from individual participants by meeting with them, observing them, and measuring their activities and outcomes. This data collection process has become so streamlined that it can be easy to forget about how that data is generated. Remembering the human component is an important guiding ethos for our research team.\nSafeguarding data, changing lives\nAfter data collection, our team processes and analyzes it following rigorous research standards in order to avoid producing biased results. Researchers’ ethical standards matter, because without these standards, the results we present would be meaningless!\nAt Transfr, our mission is to help trainees transform their lives with the tools and resources we provide. But this can only happen when we provide the tools and resources that work for our them. Constantly evaluating our products and scientifically demonstrating how they work is part of our ongoing effort to deliver only the best for our clients and the people we serve. Upholding the highest ethical standards in our research is ultimately part of how we help people from pools of undiscovered talent get on pathways towards important careers with upward mobility.\nWant to learn more about how VR can change your classroom or workplace?"

  "text": "“Do No Harm,” the Foundation of VR Healthcare Training\nThe ethical principle of nonmaleficence, or “do no harm” is foundational to caring for patients. Preventing harm to patients is a shared goal, requiring shared responsibilities across the patient-care team. Professionals committed to improving safety and outcomes for individuals seeking healthcare, must commit to designing and developing educational opportunities that effectively prepare current and future professionals and providers for the rigors of the modern healthcare world. \nReducing harm is a vital starting point for anyone developing health sciences training of any kind. When building health sciences training simulations, this do-no-harm mindset was vital for identifying common activities where harm was both possible and preventable. Once these activities were identified, a team of experts worked to translate the necessary concepts into virtual reality (VR) health sciences simulations, using language that learners of multiple disciplines could understand. Equipped with the skills conveyed by these simulations, more healthcare professionals can hopefully be trained more effectively and efficiently, in a variety of settings.\nIdentifying opportunities to reduce harm via VR healthcare training\nTransfr’s new health sciences training content, the Virtual Healthcare Clinic, is focused on reducing risk of patient harm by integrating evidence-based practices around common and preventable occurrences for harm: Falls, infection, and skin breakdown. A skilled team of healthcare experts is dedicated to improving patient safety, quality of care, and healthcare outcomes by building robust, effective healthcare training simulations. This team’s efforts are informed by deep experience in multiple facets of the healthcare world. \n“I was actively involved as a contributing member of the Patient Safety Movement Foundation’s workgroup to author an actionable evidence-based practice blueprint ebook on Culture of Safety,” says Hannah Schroeder, MSN-Ed, RN, CNE, CHSE, PCCN-K, Transfr’s Health Sciences Curriculum Manager. “A passion and affinity for integrating the science of safety, simulation, and improvement processes with the evidence-based practices in patient care and adult- and simulation-based education are evident throughout our health sciences simulations and curriculum. Education without results is wasted effort, my goal is to produce educational content that is engaging, informative, and impactful; ultimately improving patient care outcomes.”\nTo improve impact and outcomes we have conducted hundreds of fact-finding discussions with experts and external stakeholders representing employers, educational institutions, national organizations, and even the individuals providing direct care to patients and clients. These discussions provide the necessary evidence to determine prioritized roles, content areas and concepts, and key components of the overall curriculum. It is critical to integrate and implement evidence-based practices, like completing a needs assessment and gap analysis, when designing simulation-based educational experiences. \nHow VR health sciences simulations can increase training effectiveness and reduce patient harm \nImmersive, VR, simulation-based training can drive change and contribute to reducing the risk for patient harm by providing opportunities for future and current healthcare professionals to have exposure to the science of safety. Through these simulations, they can learn about, see role-modeling for, and practice supportive activities in the domains of a patient safety curriculum. \nVR healthcare simulations bring light to the rationale, steps, actions, and responsibilities that healthcare professionals must integrate into daily work to overcome commonly-encountered patient safety challenges associated with human factors, systems, and/or technology.\n“When I went to nursing school, we didn’t have any VR training. It’s great to be in the hospital doing hands-on things but a lot of times the nursing staff is very short and the amount of time you’re able to do hands-on activities is limited,” explains RN Sydney Denstorff on Upward, the Transfr podcast. “VR would have been great because repetition is huge — doing it over and over and over again.”\nThis is another place where VR healthcare training truly shines: The ability for learners to safely practice essential skills multiple times in a risk-free environment where there is zero chance of patient harm. \nVR training — the future of health sciences training\nImproved patient safety and reduced risk for harm require new dynamic partnerships as well as the use of innovative strategies that bring evidence-based education to an expanded healthcare workforce. Creating simulated clinical experiences in VR offers increased opportunities for more people to access rigorous clinical education. Improved access to high-quality simulation-based clinical education benefits our communities, classrooms, healthcare organizations, and ultimately, patients. \nVR offers learners a novel opportunity for immersive, repeatable learning, especially for learners who have been traditionally disenfranchised, have unique learning needs, or are limited by distance. Increasing career awareness and modernizing clinical training helps build a stronger, better-qualified healthcare workforce. \n“VR training provides asynchronous learning that’s repeatable and facilitates unlimited practice, anywhere.” explains Sydney Beaumont, Transfr Manager of Experience Design. “That takes the burden off of the already-pressed healthcare labor force. Those nurses can be repurposed elsewhere and people can still be practicing.”\n——–\nPublicly available resources to address patient safety concerns are available from many different organizations, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), the Patient Safety Movement Foundation (PSMF), and the World Health Organization (WHO)."

  "text": "Modernizing Healthcare Training with VR Simulations\nSimulation-based education for healthcare professionals requires specialized facilities and equipment, plus experienced staff to run them (often drawn from the ranks of working providers). The American Association of College of Nursing’s (AACN) 2021-2022 report showed that U.S. nursing schools turned away 91,938 qualified nursing program applicants in 2021 due to insufficient numbers of faculty, clinical sites, classroom space, and clinical preceptors (as well as budget constraints). The AACN also found that 150 schools (40% of those surveyed) reported that insufficient availability of clinical sites was the single most important reason for turning away qualified applicants.\nThese are all issues that our panel convened to discuss on Upward, the Transfr podcast. We were joined by Transfr’s own Lori Hardie, Registered Nurse, Director of Health Sciences, and Syndey Beaumont, Manager of Experience Design, as well as Nursing Director Lori Yates-Hodges, RN, and Registered Nurse Sydney Denstorff, to dig into how VR healthcare training can help schools and hospitals overcome these hurdles and help train more healthcare professionals. \nHear this dynamic panel talk about how to modernize healthcare training here!\nOvercoming clinical site and financial limitations with VR healthcare training\nSimulations are not new in the world of healthcare education — the difference is that VR makes simulated training more portable and compact and a lot less expensive. \n“There’s a lot of expense that comes with building simulation labs,” says Lori Hardie. “I was running one for 10 years. It’s expensive and I think that’s one thing that VR offers in contrast to traditional setups.”\nThree major areas where VR presents huge cost savings versus setting up a traditional simulation lab are that there’s no need for a dedicated physical space, buying specialized equipment, or supplying consumable materials. The majority of training repetitions for learners in a variety of disciplines can be completed in VR.\nFinding the space necessary for a simulation lab can be a challenge for many schools and hospitals, but VR healthcare training can take place anywhere — any kind of classroom or conference room can be adapted into a temporary VR simulation lab. \n“VR healthcare simulations might cost maybe a little bit upfront.” says Lori Yates-Hodges, RN. “But then we don’t have to do the maintenance and the building-out of the lab. I just see VR being way more cost effective than us trying to build our own sim lab.”\nAdditionally, VR healthcare training doesn’t require specialized tools or equipment. Trainees can also build confidence and competence in VR without the need for copious amounts of consumables (gloves and other PPE, needles, etc.), which cost the program money and end up in landfills.\n“You’re not buying mannequins that are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Lori Hardie explains, driving home the cost-savings of VR. “Or maintaining those and the actual brick and mortar spaces.”\nVR healthcare simulations — enhancing instructor capacity\nThere will never be a technological replacement for a trained, capable, compassionate human healthcare professional. There are situations where VR is uniquely well-suited to augmenting the capabilities of human instructors, allowing them to positively impact more students in the same amount of time and space.\nFinding skilled, experienced healthcare professionals to serve as instructors and clinical proctors in training settings is a complex problem. Professionals are retiring and the ones left in the system are needed bedside, carrying on as best they can as their ranks are successively thinned by an inability to train replacements. \nThis leaves healthcare educators sorely squeezed. VR healthcare training offers them a tool to enhance their reach. Contrast this to the challenges that new-graduate RN, Sydney, encountered while in clinical rotations:\n“Usually we were not well-staffed enough to have the preceptor who was training me either by my side or available for questions at all times. On numerous occasions I had to step away from a patient because I had a question and my preceptor had gone off to help another patient.”\nVR healthcare training allows students to safely practice skills in a risk-free environment. A virtual coach provides personalized, real-time feedback as students practice techniques, ensuring that they perform each step properly, even without direct, in-person, supervision. Task completion statistics are provided, allowing instructors to further evaluate learner performance and take steps to provide students what they need to succeed. \nThe future is bright for healthcare providers\nThe healthcare industry is facing countless challenges, but there is hope. The increased implementation of VR healthcare training can help close the identified gaps to train and onboard new healthcare workers. It also extends the abilities of hard-working instructors to serve more students or even existing professionals who are practicing, upskilling, or reskilling. \nHealthcare is a rewarding profession that renders an essential service, often bringing a great deal of fulfillment to the professionals who serve in these roles, as Lori Yates-Hodges recounts:\n“Nursing is really attractive in a lot of ways. We have flexible hours, it’s different from the nine-to-five grind… You can work anywhere in the world. You can teach. You can work in clinics. You can do surgery. You can deliver babies. There’s so much to this industry and unfortunately we have focused on the negative especially through the pandemic and the national shortage but we have so much to offer. It’s exciting; we get to save lives.”"

  "text": "Virtual Reality and Trends in K12 Career Exploration\nIt’s never too early to start planning for your career. K12 schools are on the forefront of preparing the next generation of workers in every industry. But helping students understand their career opportunities and pathways is a huge challenge for the hardworking professionals in these schools. We call this process career exploration (CE).\nWhile many students (and educators) still think that the “traditional” four-year college pathway is the main (or even only) way to secure a successful career, attitudes are changing. Counselors and CTE instructors are showing students (and parents) that lucrative, non-college career pathways are viable options. Jobs in the skilled trades (and a variety of other vital roles) provide upward mobility and strong earning potential — without the immense debt that many college degrees can carry.\nSpreading this message is an uphill battle, which is where virtual reality (VR) career exploration comes in. We brought together an amazing panel, which included two K12 instructors who use Transfr in their schools (Candy Parker, Business Teacher at Granite City School District and Julie Godfrey, Career Tech Director Shelby County Schools) and Superintendent Scott Feder for a robust conversation about this vital topic. Read on to dig into the most important highlights!\nChallenges in Career Exploration for K-12 schools\nThe US Department of Education estimates that 1.2 million students drop out of high school each year. The goal of CE is to drive student interest in career education before they drop out. Helping a student find a path to graduation and a well-paying job before they lose faith in the educational system will give them a better future with upward mobility and hopefully a stronger sense of purpose and satisfaction in life.\nSo what challenges are we looking to overcome to make this better future happen? For starters, while K12 career exploration is mandated by most state Departments of Education and school districts see great value in offering a multifaceted CE program, staying current and securing the resources to deliver a truly valuable career exploration curriculum isn’t always feasible or possible for a district to do on its own.\nAdditionally, students seldom understand the wide array of career opportunities available today. While young people have always sought fame as celebrities, modern social media has made the path of glitz and glamor seem much more accessible than it truly is. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that current career exploration solutions offer little student engagement that could dissuade them from this unlikely path. These offerings mainly focus on preparing students for a four-year college, so many students see no relevance.\n“We’re really good at college,” says Scott. “Our counselors are good at college, parents want college. But when we say that, that’s not going to work out for every student. What I’m looking for is, how can we get all students, especially career-bound students, to see themselves as potential success stories?”\nUnfortunately, school counselors receive limited training, resources, and information to provide truly effective CE and are ill-equipped to educate students about modern career pathways.\nWith the large caseloads counselors have little time to support students with career exploration and course selection, focusing instead on student mental health (which is vital!) and college preparation.\nHowever, some K-12 schools are changing this script. VR career exploration plus a suite of support services is helping change minds about non-college career paths.\nHow K-12 schools are using VR for career exploration\nSince joining Transfr, I’ve interviewed over a hundred school superintendents, assistant superintendents, school counselors, principals and students asking what a comprehensive career exploration program would look like. The overarching answers I got were that it should have a high volume of occupations to explore, be easy to navigate, and look visually appealing. It also needs to show students a job’s salary and skills as well as the pathway to get there. Finally, it should really give them a chance to explore.\n“I teach a career exploration class for 9th-12th grades,” says Candy. “We use career interest assessments at the beginning and end of the semester. We also reach out to incoming 8th graders using the VR headsets. The students get to see which careers they like and a lot of them decide to sign up for vocational classes. They love the headsets.”\nVR can be part of a comprehensive approach to CE that presents students with a wide range of career options and engaging activities, including real-world experiences and scenarios. Bringing in professionals from an array of different careers can be an important part of a VR-supported CE program, helping students learn more about jobs they may have gotten a taste of in a simulation:\n“Our goal is just to plant as many seeds as possible for career exploration,” says Julie. “Students just don’t know what they don’t know. We’ve really concentrated on bringing industry in to expand their understanding of opportunities in a given setting. In a hospital, typically, they might think of a surgeon, radiologist, etc. But by having industry come in and talk about the different jobs that they have, I think those things have helped.”\nShifting ideas about non-degree career pathways\nEvery student needs a Career and Academic Plan. This plan serves as a strategic roadmap, outlining an individual’s goals and objectives for their educational and professional development. For decades, most students’ plans have focused primarily on college. Student (and parent and educator) ideas on what a “good” career looks like are changing slowly and now more schools and students are designing Career and Academic Plans that include CTE training for skilled trades and other occupations, outside of the college track.\n“VR has been a great tool for our kids because they only know what they know,” Candy explains regarding career choices. “Some of them just think they’re gonna be a teacher, a nurse, you know, things like that because that’s all they’ve ever known. But Transfr has really opened their eyes. We go through all sixteen career clusters.”\nConnecting student interests, VR career exploration, and old-fashioned career guidance from an actual human being can help create robust Career and Academic Plans that really work for students and assist them in getting on career pathways towards jobs with upward mobility.\n“Our career coaches help students work on a four-year plan,” says Julie. “VR has been great. Students will talk about which sims they loved or something they didn’t like. It’s been enlightening for us to know that VR is really useful.”\nCandy echoed those sentiments regarding VR job exploration in the classroom:\n“It’s been great. Nothing but positive. We love it.”\nWant to delve into VR career exploration?"

  "text": "Why VR Electrical Construction Training is the Future\nIn the old days of teaching electrician apprentices (30+ years ago, when I started), things were very different: The multi-year process required textbooks, lots of tools and materials, and many hours of practical experience — some of it potentially dangerous!\nThe world of electrician training has evolved greatly since then! Today’s electrician apprentices and the people who educate them have a wealth of new resources at their disposal, resulting in a massively different experience for all involved. While it may seem counterintuitive to many experienced electricians and electrician teachers, virtual reality (VR) can be a powerful tool in their arsenal when it comes to giving rookies the skills they need to be safe and successful in the field (maybe even at an accelerated pace).\nVR electrical construction training can never and will never replace human instructors — and hands-on practice in lab and workplace settings will always be part of the process of creating new electricians. However, there are several unique benefits that this pioneering technology can offer: Chief among them are increased safety (training green pre-apprentices with no risk of exposure to live electricity), reducing the use consumables or special tools (less wire, conduit, etc.) needed for countless practice repetitions, and the fact that simulations are constantly being updated with new content, making it easier to keep trainees ahead of the curve with the latest techniques and advances.\nVR electrical construction training: Safe, effective\nYou don’t have to be an electrician, electrical construction teacher, or work in the skilled trades to know that working electricity can be dangerous, full stop. Some readers who’ve spent years in the industry may be reading this and think “I was trained under dangerous conditions and I came out alright!” And you did, but your past can’t be the future of an entire industry. Technology has evolved — the latest crop of trainees has new options that can keep them safer as they develop the skills they’ll need in the field as the difficulty and risk of what they’re doing increases.\nThink about how many times an electrician needs to practice a technique to get it right. Even though trainees working in VR aren’t holding the same physical tools that they’ll be using in the real world, the super-realistic feedback cues in the VR simulations and guidance from a virtual trainer with unlimited patience helps ensure that learners develop the muscle memory needed to do every task safely and correctly, every time.\nIn VR, the virtual coach delivers consistent instruction backed by decades of subject matter expert knowledge (some of it directly from me), in an environment free of the traditional hazards of electrician training.\nAdditionally, the virtual coach has unlimited patience and is 100% consistent. Imagine it: An instructor could split up a group of students — some in a totally-safe VR setting getting consistent instruction from the virtual coach, while the human instructor gives the (now-smaller) group of students in the lab even more personalized attention. It’s a huge win for instructors who are already overworked, as it can be difficult to find qualified electrician instructors.\nAnd for an illustration as to how well VR skills training works, the company we developed these sims in partnership with, TRIO Electric out of Houston, TX, did an in-house experiment. They put some of their office workers through the conduit-bending sims. The results speak for themselves:\n“We actually put some of our colleagues who’ve never been in the field through the bending simulation,” explains Sam Chiarella, Curriculum Development Lead at TRIO. “And they were able to do it on the very first try.”\nEdgar Anguilu, an instructor at TRIO, adds: “We’re talking about people who’ve been doing office work for a long time and never held a tool!”\nThe ability to get a basic understanding of a skill that used to take a high volume of consumables is a game-changer for electrical construction and countless other industries.\nVR electrician training without special tools, consumables\nThe cost of everything is rising and the materials needed to train new electricians are no exception. VR electrical construction training helps learners build actual electrical experience without the cost of specialized equipment and tools or wire, conduit, or anything else that will get used up in a training session and have to be written off. Even in situations where learning materials could be repurposed for later building projects and actually put to use, trainees need ample opportunity to make mistakes, which could result in materials being thrown out anyway!\nVR electrical construction training empowers learners, helping them become familiar with all of the equipment, tools, and materials they’ll encounter on the job without the costs of either outfitting another lab completely from scratch (or buying additional tools for your existing lab to give every student access to them) and constantly restocking supplies.\nThat’s not to say that adding VR to your program will completely alleviate your need for consumable materials — every electrician trainee needs to get their hands on the real thing at some point. But with hours of practice logged in VR, which don’t use any consumables, can help control costs for your program. And after all those repetitions, students will be that much more sure of themselves when they go into the field.\nVR electrical construction training keeps students ahead of the curve\nElectricians must be lifelong learners. If you’re a seasoned electrician, tradesperson, or skilled trades educator, take a moment and think back on how much your industry has changed over the course of your career. Pretty significant, right?\nNow think of how hard it was for you to stay on top of those changes as you worked your way through the various jobs you’ve held. Well, those changes are still happening — and at an even more rapid pace! It’s almost impossible for one person to stay on top of everything that’s happening in a complex field like electrical construction.\nWith VR simulations from Transfr, you’re not alone. A team of SMEs and learning experts are constantly updating the simulations and expanding the number of available units, ensuring that your program stays as up-to-date as possible.\nAdditionally, it’s often a challenge to pull veteran electricians (with the kind of up-to-date knowledge students need access to) from the field. VR training allows your program to leverage the latest electrical construction knowledge and keep more of your skilled workforce on the job. (And, if your company works with seasoned electricians, VR training can also be an excellent option for continuing learning and professional development.)\nI’ve seen a lot of changes in the electrical field over my career. I’m not threatened by the implementation of VR training and you shouldn’t be either! For the foreseeable future, there will always be a need for human electricians and trainers. But VR technology is here. As electricians, we strive to work smarter not work harder. VR training is another tool that you can use to improve the way you train current and future electricians."

  "text": "Yun Jin Rho’s Non-Traditional Path to Director of Data Science\nJack Cieslak \nJune 27, 2023 \nShare this story\nYun Jin Rho, PhD is the Director of Data Science at Transfr. During an interview with Upward, the Transfr Podcast, she revealed that for her, reaching this position was anything but a straight path! We’re proud of the fact that nontraditional pathways are common here at Transfr, so we sat down with her to delve into her inspiring story.\nAs leader of the Learning Intelligence team, Yun Jin heads up learning research and conducts virtual reality (VR) efficacy studies (as well as a host of other duties). The research that Yun Jin and team conduct influences product development, reveals how learners access and interact with programs and systems, and includes data on the success of different users’ journeys and job placement.\nWhen assessing people’s learning pathways and outcomes, Yun Jin draws on personal experience: A challenge she encountered during her education changed how she evaluates the ways that lives and careers can, in her words, “deviate from our expectations.”\nLearning to define success your own way\nTo Yun Jin, embracing nontraditional pathways is all about re-assessing assumptions about education, qualification, career direction, and how success is defined — then being able to adjust expectations and change course when something doesn’t work out.\n“I was actually thinking a lot [about] how I can share my story, which is a failure story. It’s not fun at all,” she noted cautiously. “Of course, if I look back, now I’m fine… I can view it as a learning experience. But if you look at my resume, people may think ‘Oh, you have a really, like, traditional linear pathway.’ Well, there is a hidden story… a resume doesn’t say everything.”\nRegarding her experiences as a student in Korea, she explained, “I was very very focused on education and getting into the top college. You know, that mindset. I grew up in Korea and we are very competitive and very much focused on education. At that time, my generation especially was all about competition — the scores that you have on any test. In Korea, after 12 years of education, after your high school, there is a one-time standardized exam that is the equivalent of an SAT or ACE. You take the exam to get into college.”\nWhen students ace the test, Yun Jin explains, the expectation is they will have their pick of schools and follow a trajectory to a well-paid white-collar professional career.\nAn educational setback shifts Yun Jin’s thinking\nBut that straight-line school-to-college-to-career pathway is far from a sure thing, Yun Jin revealed:\n“I took the exam, but at the time I had so much pressure, I couldn’t handle the stress and everything, and I couldn’t finish the test. I failed it.”\nWhile poor performance on a test might not seem like the end of the world, Yun Jin’s family and cultural expectations, as well as being a high-performing student, made it resonate heavily. To this day, she still gets emotional thinking and talking about it, and had to pause before continuing her story:\n“That failure was a big moment where I had to think about my life. As a high school student, I was a very high performer, and you know, in my head the definition of success was just flawless — no mistakes: You go to the college that you want and you get a job… So that was a tough time and there was also social stigma. After 12 years of education, there was this one time for you to show that you did a good job. My family was frustrated and everybody was frustrated. I intentionally isolated myself from all social interactions for about a year.”\nDeveloping a compassionate research philosophy\nYun Jin’s setback, while devastating at the time, also provided her with a moment of enlightenment: Rather than proceed along an expected course, Yun Jin had to reflect on the nature of academic expectations placed on students relative to perceived opportunities.\n“I started thinking that I need to redefine success,” Yun Jin says. “Anybody can make a mistake, no matter how big it is, no matter how small it is. You can make a mistake — but that mistake shouldn’t determine your success.”\nThe only successful life previously defined for her demanded academic excellence, followed by higher education, followed by a lucrative career — alternatives were non-existent. Obviously, in that context, failing the placement exam was an unmitigated catastrophe. Yet she also saw the contradiction of being a student who had excelled academically but was undermined by the pressure the exam caused.\nApproaching the future with optimism\nYun Jin was able to retake the test a year later and move forward with her life plans, however, she would ultimately become more open-minded in her approach to thinking about other people’s learning journeys and career paths:\n“From my personal experience and observations, I think that each person’s pathway comes from their mistakes and choices that they have made. There is no right way or wrong way to find success.”\nIt’s vital that students and workers receive opportunities for second chances, opportunities to try out different learning styles and job skills and change course into better-fitting careers, and for hiring managers to be more open to candidates outside narrow tracks of qualification such as “the right college major.” Regarding learning research, Yun Jin observes:\n“We are not just looking at and analyzing numbers, we are interpreting data to understand learners and educators and people behind. I’m all about people-centered research and I emphasize this point to my team members!”\nAbout Yun Jin Rho\nYun Jin Rho, Ph.D., Director of Data Science at Transfr has been in the EdTech world since 2010. She’s an inventor who holds four patents regarding learners’ skill estimation and predictive recommendation in adaptive learning. When she’s not helping build the future of VR training, she enjoys playing piano and listening to her son singing. Hear her inspiring story here!\nWant to delve into VR efficacy studies from Yun Jin’s team?\nJack Cieslak \nJack Cieslak is the Editorial Director at Transfr. He’s worked in tech for over a decade, writing for Amazon, CB Insights, and Sisense, among others. When he’s not behind a computer, he enjoys martial arts, gardening, hiking, and of course, reading.

The team at Workforce Development Board Mid-Ohio Valley (WDB-MOV) in West Virginia knows this, which is why for the second year in a row, they’re supercharging their summer CTE Explore Camp with VR simulations from Transfr. Cyndi Auth, Strategic Development Manager at WDB-MOV has been a major driving force behind the program.\n“The camp is evidence that students are hungry for interactive instruction,” says Cyndi. “By taking a multi-faceted approach to creating career awareness, students can see first hand the importance of math and science and how they directly relate to the world of work, a future that the students will soon find themselves in the midst of.”\nWe’ll recap 2022’s successes and dig into this year’s robust program. There are lots of exciting takeaways that showcase the WDB-MOV’s hard work and ingenuity as well as the value that VR can bring to in-person events like these when combined with comprehensive career path education.\nBuilding on 2022’s successes\nThe week-long CTE Explore Camp was initially launched in 2022 with a focus on expanding student knowledge of trade jobs for incoming 9th and 10th graders who might consider going into Career and Technical Education programs. Later that year a collaboration with Transfr allowed the program to expand by augmenting the curriculum to include VR simulations. This expanded the program empowered students to explore a wide array of new careers.\nVR was only part of the agenda with a wide array of daily activities for students. One highlight was daily spotlight speakers who shared their career journeys with attendees, giving them real-world stories to connect with students’ VR experiences and other research. This combination of content was designed to help students make more informed decisions about their classroom-to-career pathways.\nStudents were directed to various Transfr VR career exploration simulations based on their expressed interests, but were also given the freedom to engage with any other sims during their Transfr headset sessions.\n“By exposing students to a wide selection of careers, they are better equipped to make an informed choice of career path rather than settling for one,” said Bill Monterosso, Executive Director of WDB-MOV.\nThe 2022 camp was a rousing success! While WDB-MOV originally aimed to serve only 25 high school students, over 50 students ended up participating in the event, which was expanded to accommodate the increased interest. This year, there were three week-long sessions in four different locations, to build on last year’s schedule.\nPure turnout numbers don’t tell the whole story: The effect of Transfr’s VR career exploration simulations combined with the hands-on content and stories from trade worker guest speakers had a powerful effect. When students were asked “Has your career plan changed after this week?” 21% of respondents said “Yes!” in 2022. Among the 2023 attendees, 44% of those who completed the post-camp survey report that the experience affected their career goal.\nExpanding CTE camp to meet student demand\nThe students have spoken and the 2023 CTE Explore Camp was expanded to help even more young people decide if the skilled trades are right for them and which career path they might want to start down.\nInstead of focusing solely on VR career exploration, this year students also used Transfr’s VR skills training modules to learn vital workplace safety skills: Lock out/tag out, use of PPE, bloodborne pathogen safety, fire extinguisher, and more. This content will once again be complemented with live presentations from seasoned experts in the skilled trades, including pipefitters, electricians, ironworkers, and others!\nThe combination of human counseling and direction, told stories from the field, and VR career exploration and skills training has helped students from a variety of backgrounds get onto career pathways they may never have otherwise considered.\nThese types of activities allow the WDB-MOV crew to have a powerful impact on the communities they serve. The world of work is constantly evolving; students need state-of-the-art experiences and guidance from caring advisors and mentors to help them thread the needle and find their personal pathways to a future where they can do work they care about and contribute to their communities.\n“I like showing people how to use the VR to try jobs they wouldn’t have an opportunity to do otherwise,” says Russell Spencer, VR Tech. “This allows them to experience jobs without needing access to the costly real equipment or having to travel to where the equipment is.”"

  "text": "VR and AR Change Minds about Modern Manufacturing\nManufacturing in the US is in the midst of a powerful resurgence, creating thousands of open jobs in an industry many not have previously thought of. It might also be the best-kept secret in the American workforce, since there are still critical worker shortages in the manufacturing sector.\nJob seekers of all ages seem unaware of numerous openings in this high-demand field that can lead to a well-paying career. In other cases, job seekers might be aware there are manufacturing jobs available, but lack understanding of what a full career path looks like.\nSarah Hartwick, Vice President of Education and Workforce Policy with the Illinois Manufacturer’s Association, sat down with us on a manufacturing-focused episode of Upward, the Transfr podcast, to talk about how Illinois manufacturers are making inroads with undiscovered talent. In conversation with Mitch Dickey, a Transfr state workforce manager specializing in Illinois and Kentucky, the two explored novel methods for spreading the word about modern manufacturing and helping students and other job seekers decide if a manufacturing career is the right fit for them.\nOvercoming outdated notions about manufacturing via technology\n“One of the biggest missions of the Illinois Manufacturers Association is [changing people’s] impression that manufacturing is dark, dirty, and dangerous,” Sarah says. “It is clean. It is high tech. It is sustainable. It is diverse. It is on-shoring in ways that it has not been doing for decades because of the supply chain crisis we saw during COVID. It is a very strong career, and more modernized than it was before.”\nThis shift in attitudes around manufacturing jobs came about as a result of a two-pronged dilemma: The public perceived that “good jobs” in the US manufacturing sector were drying up due to a host of economic shifts (including offshoring), which led many schools and students to turn away from highlighting or exploring paths to manufacturing careers; the pipeline for new trainees and workers eventually dried up. Following this dramatic decline, and even now during a strong upsurge, vital skilled jobs in the sector go unfilled.\nThe state of Illinois is an excellent example for both the problem and applied solutions. There is a very strong manufacturing sector across Illinois:\n“Our economic output is over $54 billion annually,” Sarah explains. “An average [manufacturing employee] salary in Illinois is over $79,000 a year, we have over 660,000 employees.” Yet in the same breath she mentions, “there are still 800,000 job openings within the manufacturing sector across the country.”\nProviding pathways to manufacturing careers\nSolving this crisis of missing workers requires an across-the-board effort: For starters, CTE (Career and Technical Education) may be lacking in schools. Sarah cited that the IMA had successfully backed a bill requiring Illinois high schools to include rigorous CTE programming in their curricula.\nAnother challenge to filling these roles is that students and job seekers may not be aware of all of the opportunities in their area, the wide array of jobs that could be a good fit, or how to acquire needed training. Partnerships between educational institutions, private businesses, and state and local workforce development can help remedy these problems. A unique way that IMA has started tackling them has been to create a bus tour (partnering with Transfr for 2023!) taking students to manufacturing plants across the state — in some cases demonstrating that name brand manufacturing was going on practically in their own backyards.\nWhile Sarah acknowledges that high schools and community colleges are key in reaching out to the workers of tomorrow, a remaining (and significant) hurdle is changing the minds of older generations, be they the parents of high school students, or people already in the workforce but making a career change.\n“So many people don’t know what a manufacturing job looks like today,” Sarah says. “They don’t know that it’s so high tech.”\nAnd new high tech jobs require tech-savvy training methods, another benefit to today’s worker.\nUsing tomorrow’s technology to train tomorrow’s manufacturing workforce\nNoting that exposure and pathways are key, Transfr’s Mitch Dickey opines, “If you can’t see it, you can’t be it.”\nThat is to say: Expanding career exploration and career pathing is essential for job seekers to make informed decisions.\nMitch suggested taking on the problem as “both a workforce issue and an equity issue. How can we expand this workforce to be accessible to folks in every single background [including those who] have been underserved for a long time?”\nMany potential manufacturing workers also lack essential exposure to the career possibilities — if no one in your family or immediate community had a great manufacturing job, understandably you might look elsewhere. As Mitch puts it, “If you don’t know what this career looks like [or] anything about the career, how are you supposed to know if it’s something that fits you?”\nCareer exploration in the form of VR and AR are particularly helpful in that they can provide a wider degree of job exposure and even cover some manufacturing training fundamentals while mitigating some of the expense involved in outfitting a CTE lab with equipment replicating modern manufacturing processes — and keeping it up to date. Rather, VR manufacturing training can provide a much more compelling taste of what the day-to-day would be like on a particular job.\nClosing the gap in the manufacturing industry will require a coordinated effort in career exploration and training where manufacturers, schools, workforce development boards, and other businesses and organizations serving students and job seekers work together to build awareness of these career paths. Sarah felt optimistic that the manufacturing industry was gaining momentum and gearing up to tackle the needs and concerns of the 21st Century:\n“We’re at a really cool time where people should be seeing what manufacturing floors look like today. They don’t know that it’s so high-tech, they don’t know what it pays. Newer generations want to be passionate about their career. They want to feel that they have an impact.”"

If they didn’t, we wouldn’t have podcasts, documentaries, home repair shows, or the very concept of “edutainment.” (We tip our hats to Sesame Street for helping pioneer this notion!) But it’s easy to forget how enjoyable learning can be when no one seems to want to attend another workplace “training’ and when the White House is issuing warnings about the rise of chronic absenteeism in American schools. If learning is so much fun, why are people so eager to avoid it?\nThe problem, I would argue, is that the general sweep of education has managed to coalesce around extremely passive experiences, as opposed to injecting more active learning opportunities into curricula. The primary requirement for “learning” has been (and continues to be) having someone tell us what we need to know. Having studied learning and memory for the past 25 years, I can tell you that this model is not the most effective way for most people to learn.\nThe mere transmission of information is, at best, the start of the learning process. What happens next is what determines how successful (and enjoyable!) the learning experience will be. The key to both — success and enjoyment — is allowing the learner to actively engage with, rather than passively receive, new knowledge.\nIn this article, I’ll explain why virtual reality (VR) training simulations are particularly well-suited for harnessing the power of activity to produce effective and even joyful learning experiences. We should begin by familiarizing ourselves with the concept of “active learning”.\nLearners prefer active learning\nAs mentioned in the intro, the modal (or most common) learning experience one will encounter today is decidedly passive. The learner listens or observes while an instructor (teacher, parent, workplace supervisor, etc) explains or demonstrates how something works or is done. The learner is responsible for little more than maintaining the appearance of dutiful attention. In group settings, where individual learners are likely to feel less seen or when teaching is remote or automated, even the minimal obligation to appear interested can be reduced (or even disappear altogether).\nCompare this to active learning: Active learning is a catch-all term that refers to a wide variety of scenarios in which learners are required to do something with incoming information. A simple (but potent) example is requiring learners to answer questions about what they’re hearing or seeing as a lesson unfolds. Critically, learners need to be “on the hook” for their answers in order for it to count as active learning. If people are allowed to treat the questions as mere suggestions to stop and reflect, or if people can look to someone else to provide an answer, the critical element of activity is lost.\nResearch has shown that students learn more via active vs. passive learning (Freeman et al., 2014; Prince, 2004). Students also enjoy having activity added to educational settings (Lyle & Crawford, 2011), which should come as no surprise. Most of us can attest to the pain of sitting through a passive learning experience, straining to make ourselves stay focused and counting the minutes until we can get back to doing something. Adding an activity flips this script: It gives us a reason to stay on task and, often, it gives us a sense of accomplishment. Performing activities can help us see that we are learning.\nThe active learning benefits of VR\nUnfortunately, even when the value of adding activity to learning scenarios is recognized, there can be obstacles to incorporating it. For example, when teaching a hands-on procedure (say an aspect of airplane maintenance), an instructor might want students to actually participate in the activity directly, but find that limited time and resources make that impractical. There may even be basic safety concerns.\nVR training simulations can put activity front and center in the learning process for all students. In a Transfr sim, students are constantly doing: They don’t have to wait for an entire procedure to be explained before they try it themselves — they start interacting with virtual tools and objects immediately. Activity and instruction are fully integrated. And the activity continues after instruction when students are required to recreate the procedure on their own.\nHere at Transfr, we’ve been studying the impacts of our sims from a variety of angles, including both learning outcomes and user enjoyment. Consistent with prior research on the value of integrating activities into the learning process, we’re finding that when we compare sims to passive teaching tools (slide decks, videos), people remember more from sims and enjoy them more.\nActive learning with VR engages users\nThe power of active learning in a VR setting isn’t just obvious from improved outcomes, but also from the way learners talk about their time in the headset: When research study participants rate their enjoyment of their learning experience, as well as their enthusiasm for future sim usage, they often max out the rating scales with the highest scores possible! (This is highly unusual in research studies like these, as any researcher will tell you.)\nThis joyful reaction seems to be driven in part by how easily the sims capture the learner’s attention. Participants tell us that it’s much easier to pay attention to sims versus more passive forms of teaching. For anyone who’s uncertain about the amazing potential that VR has to change lives by giving learners not just vital job skills but also engaging our human love of learning, I’ll leave you with the words of one excited study participant:\n“You can’t really not pay attention to [the simulations]. You’ve got the headset on your head, you’re looking forward, you’ve got the man talking to you about things you have to click. You’re constantly interacting with it to the point where you almost can’t not be paying attention. That’s what’s so good about it.”\nWant to learn more about VR effectiveness?\nKeith Lyle \nDr. Keith Lyle, Director of Learning Sciences at Transfr, has been studying learning and memory for 25 years. He is the author of nearly 50 scientific papers and has received multiple research grants from the National Science Foundation. His many hobbies include going to the movies, running, reading comic books, and practicing the peaceful martial art of aikido."

  "text": "Study Finds VR Electrical Construction Training Highly Effective for Beginners\nLearners remembered more from a sim when they played it compared to passively watching someone else play it. When given real tools and objects, learners correctly performed 62% of the steps in the actively-trained task versus only 51% for the passively-trained task, a statistically significant difference: t(23) = 2.24, p < .05, d = 0.46. It’s estimated that 68% of students will learn better via active training versus passive.\nParticipants enjoyed playing sims much more than watching a recording and found it much easier to pay attention to lesson content when playing versus watching. When actively playing a sim, versus passively watching, participants reported enjoying the lesson 34% more and found it 32% easier to pay attention. It’s estimated that 86% of students will enjoy active learning more than passive methods and 80% will find it easier to pay attention."

  "text": "Transfr CEO Bharani's Nontraditional Career Path\nTransfr is all about helping people from all walks of life find their own unique pathways to prosperity. What those pathways look for varies wildly from person to person. We know the highschool-to-college route of the last several decades doesn’t work for everyone — we also know that everyone has the potential to do great things, if given the chance.\nThat commitment starts right here, in-house at Transfr. Our teams are wall to wall with people from unique and interesting backgrounds not often seen in tech. Founder and CEO Bharani Rajakumar even has a nontraditional career path of his own.\nWe sat down with Bharani on Upward, the Transfr podcast, to talk about the unique path he took to becoming Transfr CEO, as well as his vision of offering diverse pathways for career success and upward mobility to everyone.\nDefining a nontraditional career pathway\nBahrani’s path to business leader wasn’t linear:\n“My first job was at Wendy’s,” he said with a laugh during the interview. “I grew up in Gainesville, Florida then moved to New York City.”\nAs the son of hardworking immigrants, he recalls that while growing up he’d never thought of being a founder or CEO or going into the business world. Working (including his first fast food job) was considered a positive contribution to family well-being. His relatives’ definition of success, however, was based around joining certain high-profile professions:\n“Science was [the] focus. In traditional Indian families, you become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. None of those really pumped me up.”\nAfter studying hard and working in finance, the idea for Transfr began to take shape: There must be better paths for those entering the workforce to find well-paid work that suits them.\n“I bet you there’s a lot of people out there like me.” Bharani said, regarding his circuitous career path. “Transfr’s goal is to help people struggling to find a career. We want to help them seize the right opportunity and click with an employer so that they can positively contribute to their communities and families.”\nIn a material society, doing well is part of the equation.\n“The genesis of Transfr is ‘How do we build a system [for] everyone to get on a career path to upward mobility’?” says Bharani.\nIt was the pursuit of that vision that ultimately put Bharani in the driver’s seat at Transfr: “I kind of became de facto CEO and founder… nobody else wanted to leave their job to do it.”\nPathways beyond four-year colleges\n“People focus on getting into ‘the right school’ — as early as elementary school!” Bharani observed. “It can be really stressful! [Nontraditional pathways are an] equalizer. The reality is, not everyone can attend a Top-20 school.”\nThis focus on “the right schools” and other highly competitive and exclusionary educational pathways leaves a lot of people feeling like their chances for a good life are nonexistent. On the other side of the coin, companies talk a lot about a “worker shortage,” completely missing that what’s actually going on is a mismatch when it comes to directing workers to fields where jobs need doing.\n“We focus on people we refer to as ‘undiscovered talent,’” Bharani explained. “These folks have a lot to offer, but companies haven’t met them yet.”\nIn short, a determined person can leverage career training and transferable experience to be as viable (or more!) than a graduate from a four-year college or university program.\nHow and why employers benefit from nontraditional candidates\nBharani also opined on the macroeconomic forces potentially driving a sea change in hiring:\n“Number 1 is Baby Boomers retiring to the tune of about 11,000 people per day. Companies are feeling the crunch. Number 2, there are a lot of folks out there questioning whether the traditional higher ed model is for them.”\nTo efficiently pair quality jobs with excellent undiscovered candidates, Bharani says that companies must “come to the conclusion that great talent can come from a lot of different places. It doesn’t have to come from a specific pedigree, program or geography.”\nNontraditional candidates are an underused asset for companies and organizations, representing unexplored paths in the existing job market. Today’s workers aren’t interested in “any job,” but in opportunities for upward mobility and advancement. However, they might not know where to focus.\nHow AR and VR career exploration can help with career exploration and pathing\nTransfr’s goals include leveraging AR and VR technologies to help students and transitioning workers explore careers in well paying, in-demand jobs that best suit their strengths.\n“We help workforce development agencies, employers and education — high schools and two-year colleges — in ‘career exploration,’ where someone can put on a headset,” Bharani said, “and advise, develop, co-create curriculums to get people on a pathway. The last thing we want is for people to graduate and just be lost… that’s the premise of our business model.”\nInsights into training and overall career path options empower candidates to direct themselves towards a better tomorrow. VR and AR experiences are a powerful way to give learners a fuller sense of which jobs are a right fit for them and how to prepare for and secure them.\n“What we’re excited about is creating classroom-to-career pathways,” Bharani enthused. “We want to help folks get the skills that they need: Hands-on training and exposure.”\nHe’s optimistic about the capabilities of VR allowing learners to try out what a variety of occupations might be like, and then enroll in a program that they feel makes the most sense for them, ultimately leading to job placement.\nWith insights in-hand, the playing field is more level for everyone to find a place that’s the right fit. Bharani believes it’s the foundation elevating workers to ask more self-actualizing, and ultimately more satisfying, questions about directing their career: “How would you like to contribute? What interests you? What excites you? What motivates you in the morning?”\nAbout Bharani\nBharani Rajakumar, Transfr founder and CEO, was also the co-founder of math tutoring software vendor LearnBop. In 2016, Bharani received the “Outstanding Leader of the Year” award from the US Distance Learning Association. He founded Transfr in 2017 using his understanding of how people learn, what gets them excited, and what skills they need to master in order to create their own pathways to career success."

  "text": "The Key to Changing Lives with VR Training\nThe key to any large-scale human endeavor is collective intention and action; we are strongest when we work together. The challenges we face now — an aging population retiring from key jobs in manufacturing, electrical work, plumbing, construction, and other vital industries, coupled with decreased interest in the skilled trades — can’t be solved without first coming together. \nIt’s going to become increasingly difficult to find people with the skills and abilities that are needed for the open roles available today: The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows 47,500 open machinist roles, Earlbeck.com reports there’ll be a shortage of 400,000 welders by 2024, and the US Department of Labor projects a nationwide deficit of 800,000 electricians by 2030!\nOnly by bringing together schools, government agencies, industry partners, and community organizations like Goodwill and The Boys & Girls Club can we hope to fill these roles and get people from pools of undiscovered talent into well-paying jobs in high-demand industries. That’s why, as 2023 dawns, we’ve made collective intention one of our core focus areas.\nCollective intention — the key to changing lives with VR training\nSo, we know it takes a team to accomplish great things. Why focus on this now? Because for the past five years, we’ve been building something truly ambitious here at Transfr, a company dedicated not just to a product, but to an ideal. We want to put more people on their own personal pathways to prosperity and we know we can’t do that alone.\nOur strength as a company is about so much more than just great hands-on VR simulations. It’s in our people.\nOur strength as a company is about so much more than just great hands-on VR simulations. It’s in our people. Every day our workforce advisors, government relations experts, and customer success managers are out there, talking to real people. They’re not just helping them get the most they can out of Transfr VR training and career exploration, they’re helping them connect with other schools and agencies in their areas to help get more students and job seekers into the right training and open roles for them.\n“There are a slew of barriers out there preventing people from getting onto pathways to high-paying, in demand careers — not just the skills gap,” says Research Analyst Kate Kimmer. “At Transfr, we never shy away from a challenge. For the past year, I have led the research on creating successful ecosystems of economic empowerment for youth and adults with justice involvement, a project that could not be closer to my heart. Collective intention fuels the success of our end-users, demanding a level of creativity, collaboration, and dynamism that Transfr. ”\nThe dedicated Product teams here at Transfr know all about collective intention as well, pooling their myriad skills to make some of the best hands-on learning simulations the industry’s ever seen. They weave the knowledge, wisdom, and experience of countless experts into complex simulations, together with VR experts from around the globe. All the while, our Creative and Marketing teams are liaising with our clients, sharing their stories with the world, helping more people see and understand that when we work together, we really can make a difference in the lives of job seekers and those entering the workforce.\nThere are countless employers out there looking to share opportunities with people and help them get on career paths. There are also people in need of jobs or just getting out of high school who are uncertain about the role of higher ed in their own pathway to prosperity. Not everyone will go to a four-year college — or needs to, in order to secure a well-paying job in a high-demand industry. By partnering with two-year colleges, CTE schools, employers, workforce development boards, and community organizations, we can better reach these uncertain job seekers and help everyone plot their own course through life.\n“This is ultimately the way our Go-To-Market team operates every day,” says Hall Charter, Transfr Director of Sales. “Collective intention drives our efforts both internally and externally to build community partner ecosystems. We bring together organizations with one common goal: Helping people on a path to upward mobility. It’s extremely exciting to wake up everyday with the privilege of working with partners that share a common mission, and knowing that somebody somewhere is using Transfr to learn the skills they need to succeed.”\nThis is our moment to work together to change things for the next generation and help more people find their unique niches in society and pathways to prosperity. We’re committed to working together with every organization out there to get more people trained and into the right job for them, right away! If you’re reading this, we’re committed to working with you too! \nWorking together at Transfr and beyond!\nWorking together starts at home, so we’ve made 2023 our year to intensify how we mindfully work together across the organization to do more and spread our message that together, we can accomplish what no one has done before.\nWe started by looking internally at our organization as a whole, creating new ways to help our diverse departments work together. At Transfr, we unite unique pools of talent from different industries, from undiscovered talent pools, and from locations across the country, all offering different perspectives. Rather than see this as a challenge, we’ve always looked at this diversity in talent as an incredible opportunity to better understand our learners, who also come from diverse places in the world and in life. \n“Transfr’s collective intention is reflected in the composition of our staff, as many of us have served as economic or workforce development professionals, educators, and nonprofit directors,” says Transfr Grants Director Faith Murphree. “Our collective knowledge and passions — when combined with our product and incredible partners — have the power to positively impact the workforce at-large.” \nIt may seem ambitious, but our mission is to connect all the dots internally and externally. We intend to walk the walk and lead the way. We know the only way to build robust classroom-to-career pathways is to unite stakeholders across education, government, and industry, which can only be done if we ourselves are a unified team. \nExternally, this has already translated to us working with clients in all 50 states in an array of applications: Various industries, government agencies, schools, community organizations, and more. We serve adults and school-aged children, as well as marginalized groups. Whoever you are, if our simulations or our connections to other agencies could help you, we want to be there for you!\n“The synergy created by Transfr’s collective intention is dynamic!” says Transfr Career Success Manager Suny McKaughan. “Collective intention motivates us as we collaborate internally and externally with every education, business, and government partner and potential partner we meet. As a company we know why we exist and we’re confident that our partnerships can help provide individuals with the opportunity for a better future.”\nBuilding a better tomorrow, collectively\nTransfr’s mission is to train pools of undiscovered talent to be the future of every industry. We aim to help every person we can get on a pathway to a well-paying job in a high-demand industry. We know we can’t do it alone, but do it we must. \nBy working together as a company and helping build connections between government agencies, community groups, schools, companies, and everyone else who shares our vision of the future, we hope to help build a better world.

  "text": "Empowering Justice-Impacted People with VR\nKate Kimmer \nOctober 24, 2023 \nShare this story\nAccording to PrisonPolicy.org, there are nearly two million incarcerated people in the United States on any given day. Approximately 95% will return to our communities, most hoping for the ability to live freely, find prosperity, and provide for their families. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of current adult reentry and juvenile programs aimed at reducing recidivism through rehabilitation, many states struggle with recidivism rates at or above 40%, meaning that almost half of justice-impacted people will continue the cycle of arrest and incarceration.\nHowever, there is hope! Strategic partnerships in collective-impact models can drive amazing outcomes for some of the most vulnerable learners. These partnerships help increase access to social supports for housing, mental health and recovery services, education, and workforce development training. Initiatives like these reduce recidivism and save millions of tax dollars. The U.S. Department of Education reports a 5x ROI for every dollar invested in prison educational programs.\nAt Transfr, we’ve seen the amazing ability these programs have to change lives. When a variety of organizations work together, leveraging a suite of services and the latest technology, the potential is simply inspiring.\nWhat does an effective recidivism-reduction program look like?\nPrimary and secondary research conducted by Transfr across existing juvenile justice and reentry ecosystems has identified the multiple barriers to accomplishing successful reintegration: Key work-related barriers include getting and keeping a living-wage job as well as limited literacy and/or foundational education. Social and/or behavioral skills related to the workplace may also be an issue, such as impulse control, critical thinking, conflict resolution, communication, professionalism, punctuality, and taking feedback or constructive criticism.\nThese challenges may be in addition to and compound endemic issues afflicting justice-involved communities like exiting incarceration with debt, lack of housing (or lack of safe housing), and addiction/substance use.\n“One way we support individuals that we’ve placed in our VR program is by understanding that when an individual comes home from incarceration, he doesn’t have anything,” says Mark Mitchell, Associate Director and Director of Reentry Services for Teamwork Englewood, a nonprofit in Chicago. “Most reentry organizations want them to come to the office weeks at a time without any funds. We provide bus cards for them.”\nIn order to overcome these complex, compound challenges, partner organizations need to present comprehensive collections of services. The programs that are most successful at reducing recidivism include assistance with vocational or technical skills (to help program participants get jobs), education, interpersonal and employability skills, and mental health support. Counselors and other staff members should also be adept at helping participants motivate themselves to make meaningful change in their lives and connect them with mentors and peers who can support them in their journeys.\nYouth and adults exiting incarceration or completing at-home monitoring are presented with a mountain of challenges and barriers to successful reentry that take an invested ecosystem to address.\nHow Transfr partners are helping\nTransfr partners with 45 organizations in 25 states to serve justice-impacted youth and adults, using immersive VR simulations to support educational and workforce development. These organizations provide opportunities and experience for people from pools of untapped talent, helping justice-impacted individuals connect with meaningful support and employment.\nAll skills training and career exploration VR simulations from Transfr are focused on well-paying careers in high-growth industries. These roles do not require a 4-year degree and are in need of skilled workers.\n“The best Transfr story that I have,” says Vicki Burton, VP of Goodwill of Mississippi. “Is an individual who came out of the prison system and started our Transfr VR program, our digital skills classes, while in the prison system… We took him into one of our stores, but one of the things that he realized through the VR simulations was that he wanted to be a forklift driver. He had never done it before. But it was what he really wanted to do. So we were able to send him to forklift driver training. He is currently driving a forklift at Continental Tire in Mississippi, and says this is where he will retire from this is his forever job, because of the experience he got with virtual reality simulations through Transfr.”\nOffering education, training, and connection inside facilities can also lead to increased employment rates, decreased recidivism, and more engagement with community-based resources. According to recent research conducted by Transfr’s Learning Intelligence Department, VR simulations help learners retain more information. A study conducted with over 1,800 students at Texas State Technical College showed a 40% increase in “A” grades after VR simulations were introduced.\nA study by Adams et al found that CTE programs reduced the likelihood of recidivism by 13 percentage points for inmates who took more than 200 hours (compared to those who took less than 200 hours or none at all). Another study by Lichtenberger et al found that CTE programs increased employment opportunities and reduced disciplinary records in prison. Transfr partners use VR to augment and expand existing workforce programs, engage and recruit new learners, and guide career navigation. Transfr’s suite of implementation guides are grounded in educational best practices like flipped classroom and differentiated learning models.\nBuilding a foundation for lasting change\nMaking and sustaining behavioral change requires opportunity, ability, and motivation. Inspiring hope and a realistic vision of success upon reentry is an integral part of the actualization of that success upon release. Many leave incarceration still stuck at the ‘pre-contemplation’ or even the ‘contemplation’ stage of the Stages of Change. Programs leveraging VR learning tools from Transfr can help justice-impacted people prepare and take action.\nBeyond helping their audiences learn new skills, Transfr clients report that bringing virtual reality into prisons, jails, and juvenile justice centers creates positive ripples including creating excitement about learning, increasing positive behaviors through incentive programs, and fostering hope for a better tomorrow. Transfr’s VR simulations offer justice-impacted individuals the chance to be transported to new places and spaces. They have sparked excitement, provide an opportunity to experience and master new technology, increased program engagement, and boosted morale. Joe Jordan, President & CEO of Boys&Girls Club of Fort Wayne says this regarding VR’s capacity to help justice-impacted people:\n“We partner with juvenile justice because I think that’s really where the services that we provide can really make the difference.”\nWant to learn more about how VR helps justice-impacted people?\nKate Kimmer \nKate Kimmer is the Director of Special Populations Initiatives at Transfr. After 13 years in anti-human trafficking leadership positions, Kate now focuses on prevention and intervention. In her current role, Kate works towards the economic empowerment of historically and presently marginalized communities including justice-impacted youth and adults, BIPOC communities, and survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking."

  "text": "Addressing the Healthcare Staffing Crisis with VR Training\nThe healthcare industry is in crisis: Healthcare professionals are overworked, nearing retirement and leaving the profession. In 2022, 41% of doctors and 49% of nurses reported burnout and 34% of nurses planned to leave their jobs by the end of the year. Healthcare facilities are having trouble filling open roles. Challenges in recruiting and training the next generation of professionals in the coming years point to a looming, sustained crisis of care in the decades to come. \nSolving this complex problem will require human ingenuity and technological innovation. For a recent episode of Upward, the Transfr podcast, we sat down with Transfr’s own Lori Hardie, Registered Nurse and Director of Health Sciences, and Syndey Beaumont, Manager of Experience Design, as well as Nursing Director Lori Yates-Hodges, and Registered Nurse Sydney Denstorff to dig into the facts on the ground and talk about how VR training can help!\nHear this amazing panel talk about healthcare challenges and possibilities here!\nThe scope of the challenge: Healthcare workers burning out and retiring\nWorking in healthcare is challenging and the COVID pandemic has only exacerbated existing issues in the industry. Professionals are burning out and retiring at an alarming rate, which spells disaster for the U.S.’s aging population. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that by 2034, there will be 77.0 million people aged 65 years and older compared to 76.5 million people under the age of 18. \n“There’s a nursing shortage across the country for a variety of reasons,” Lori Yates-Hodges, RN says. “The pandemic led a lot of nurses away from healthcare due to the workload — the inability to have a break in 12 or 14 hours is really hard.”\nStrenuous workloads and stressful working conditions have forced numerous healthcare professionals out of the field, or into non-clinical roles. Either way, the bottom line is fewer trained professionals to care for patients and more grueling shifts for those healthcare professionals who stick it out. The present educational infrastructure is insufficient to tackle the challenges of training adequate numbers of healthcare professionals to meet present and future staffing needs.\n“There aren’t enough schools. There’s not enough training. There’s not enough equipment to use. There’s not enough simulation labs. There aren’t enough teachers,” Lori Yates-Hodges explains. “People also don’t want to go and work and teach nursing because the pay is almost half of what you can make in the clinical area.”\nIn addition to training new healthcare professionals, recruiting, hiring, and onboarding is exacerbating the crisis.\n“In the last five years, hospitals have turned over one hundred and five percent of their staff,” Lori Hardie says. “Staff nurses are constantly onboarding new hires.”\nVR healthcare simulations offer unique benefits in terms of quickly training and onboarding new healthcare professionals.\nOvercoming training hurdles with VR healthcare training\nTwo key factors affecting how quickly schools can effectively train healthcare professionals are clinical site options and trained instructors who can give personalized feedback and direction as students practice key healthcare skills. Lack of clinical sites has a profound effect on the number of new healthcare professionals that can be trained. The American Association of Critical-Care Nurses found that 150 schools (40%) reported that lack of available clinical sites was the primary reason for not accepting all qualified applicants. \nVR healthcare training offers unique benefits to address these challenges. Headsets are highly portable and the virtual environment recreates actual healthcare settings, allowing participants to develop familiarity with these workplaces without having to build elaborate simulation centers. A virtual coach gives learners real-time feedback as they safely learn and practice essential skills like donning and doffing personal protective equipment and taking vital signs. Every repetition a student can do in VR is one less time a human instructor has to supervise.\n“What VR training provides is asynchronous learning that’s repeatable and facilitates unlimited practice, anywhere.” Sydney Beaumont explains. “That takes the burden off of the already-pressed healthcare labor force. Those nurses can be repurposed elsewhere and people can still be practicing.”\nRN Sydney Denstorff had only recently completed her nursing degree prior to appearing on the podcast and had this to say about hands-on training in these programs, and the possibilities presented by VR healthcare training: \n“The amount of time that I was actually able to do hands-on activities while in school was somewhat limited. We just had to get it done and move on to the next patient because of time constraints. Practicing in virtual reality would have been great because for me, repetition is huge. There are also those rare scenarios that you’re not going to see in school or an orientation, but you’re going to encounter them at some point.”\nVR healthcare training: The future of the healthcare workforce\nIn an industry as complex as healthcare, there are no quick fixes. However, with current professionals laboring under taxing conditions, leveraging VR healthcare training offers unique benefits to overcoming training challenges, especially around the availability of trained instructors and providing unlimited practice to trainees. \n“Because the two biggest pain points are lack of clinical faculty and lack of clinical sites,” Lori Hardie explains. “The alternative is immersive technology where you can actually have hands-on practice that’s remote, scalable, and portable. Obviously, we can’t create more faculty, but what this offers is an additional tool in the toolbox to expand the bandwidth of current healthcare faculty and educators.”"

  "text": "Transfr’s Career Exploration Evolves Possibilities\nCareer exploration is a vital part of every student and adult job seeker’s journey. In schools and workforce boards alike, career counselors face heavy caseloads, leaving them with less and less time to spend with each student or job seeker. Combine this with an economy in tumult and an evolving workforce with renewed focus on the skilled trades, and conditions are right for possible crisis — or opportunity.\nVR job exploration offers unique benefits to instructors, counselors, and explorers (students and job seekers crafting their training pathways): Namely helping explorers delve into a wide array of different jobs without special equipment or visiting numerous job sites, streamlining research activities, and giving instructors and counselors more time to focus on the unique ways they can help guide their charges.\n“Career exploration right now is primarily limited by student and facilitator time constraints,” shared Tom Darling, Transfr’s Director of Product-Market Fit in this article about career exploration. “You also have students who just don’t see the relevance of career exploration.”\nWe dug into what’s new about our career exploration product on an episode of Upward, the Transfr podcast, with Transfr’s own Bryant Harrison, Director of Product Management, and Shelley Hu, Executive Producer, about why VR career exploration is such a game-changer!\nWhat is career exploration and how did we build it?\nSimply put, career exploration refers to a collection of activities that students and explorers undertake to determine which roles and industries fit their interests and skills. Equipped with this understanding, they work with counselors and instructors to construct their personal training pathways to go from where they are now to a fulfilling career in a field with upward mobility and growth potential.\nTransfr’s VR career exploration offering developed organically back in 2020, as we discovered that some organizations were using our skills training simulations to determine if explorers might be interested in this or that career option:\n“The original career exploration product was an evolution that came from understanding how people were using our virtual training facility product,” Bryant explains. “Employers wanted help filling talent pipelines and driving interest in careers. We also heard from K12 schools and CTE programs that they had all these young people who didn’t know what they wanted to do yet. They thought VR would be a great way to expose people to all these different careers out there. We picked 23 of our virtual training facility simulations that represented a bunch of different career paths, made some user experience changes, and packaged them up into a separate application. It was wildly successful.”\nFrom that powerful start (which also grew out into our augmented reality career exploration offering), organizations using Transfr couldn’t get enough: “When are more career exploration sims coming out?” “Can you make them shorter?” “Can they have more engaging activities?” We knew we had a powerful mandate from our partners to overhaul the career exploration offering and reach more people and change more lives.\nWhat’s new in Career Exploration?\nAgain: There are a lot of people out there who need guidance building their career pathways and the professionals seeking to help them don’t have much time per person to help them, so job one was simultaneously expanding our array of job options and shortening the sim duration.\n“The first big change is that the sim duration is a lot shorter,” says Shelley. “Originally these sims were designed to have a trainee master a skill and could go up to like 15-20 minutes. Customer feedback was that they wanted explorers to just get a taste of what it’s like to have this career. So we cut them a lot shorter, to the three-to-five minute range. Now explorers can get through a lot more experiences in a sitting.”\nThe ability to get through a lot of different experiences is less impactful if there’s not a wide range of careers to choose from. Increasing the volume and variety of jobs was also super important, as Shelley explains:\n“We’re also providing a lot more career clusters. Originally CE had 4 out of our now 16 clusters and our goal is to try to have careers in all 16 clusters eventually. We’re also prioritizing fields like health science, as that’s one of the most-requested industries by our customers.”\nDiverse career options are important, as are diverse voices and providing experiences that make VR more accessible to all users. While our virtual coach Simon has been with us for a while, expanding the team of career coaches and adding accessibility features like closed captioning will help explorers of all kinds see more of themselves in the simulations they do.\n“We’ve added a lot more diversity in our simulations,” Shelley says. “Instead of using Simon over and over again, we now have a unique coach in almost every single simulation. So, when students get to try 3 to 5 simulations, they’re accompanied by 3 to 5 different coaches from different genders and racial and cultural backgrounds.”\nImproving career exploration — and lives\nThe pace of change in the economy and worlds of work is faster than ever before. Almost no one today is equipped to deal with it, but hopefully with Transfr in their corner, schools, workforce boards, community organizations, and other groups will be better equipped to help their audiences find the unique pathways to prosperity that work for them.\nWith more simulations and more career clusters to choose from, accessibility enhancements, and a more diverse array of career coaches — plus a host of other improvements, hopefully more explorers than ever before will be filled with hope for their futures in the real world after spending some time in a virtual one."

  "text": "Transfr and TRIO Electric Electrical Construction VR Sims\nThe electrical construction industry is in crisis: Electricians are retiring at an unsustainable pace — the industry is dealing with a shortage of at least 500,000 electricians in 2022, which will only get worse. To help avert the crisis that a shortage of these vital workers would cause, Transfr partnered with TRIO Electric, a Houston-based electrical construction company, to build industry-leading hands-on simulations to augment TRIO’s own training programs and help empower schools and CTE programs of all kinds to get their local learners on the path towards rewarding careers in the Electrical Construction field. \nWe sat down with former Transfr Director of Instructional Design Kelly Novic and Electrical Construction subject matter experts (SMEs) Johnnie Parker and Myron Laurent on Upward, the Transfr podcast, to discuss how we built these new training modules, how they’ll change lives and revolutionize training for the industry, and dug into what makes these modules so powerful for learners and training programs.\nCheck out what these skilled experts had to say about building the future of electrical construction training!\nCreating career pathways with VR electrical construction training\nElectricians are disappearing: A huge proportion of electricians are set to retire in the next 20 years, leaving a projected deficit that employers are scrambling to avert. \n“In the last year alone we had over 70,000 new job vacancies in the United States for skilled workers in the electrical construction field,” said Kelly. “These vacancies cover various titles from journeyman electrician to electrical specialist, but the median advertised salary is over $57,000.”\nEvery new set of modules Transfr builds is an immense undertaking; and the factors that go into that decision are diverse and complex. Any content area we build sims for needs to help learners from pools of undiscovered talent get on career pathways into a well-paying job in industries with serious growth potential. Electrical construction is just one of those industries. \nHow SMEs worked backwards to build the future of EC training\nThis was an ambitious project, but it had a solid foundation: TRIO’s preexisting electrical training curriculum which they had been using for years to train apprentices and help them be more effective the day they step onto a job site. The curriculum covered a wide range of vital skills for new apprentices, but translating those lesson plans to VR was no mean feat. \nThe Transfr Instructional Design team and SMEs, Johnny Parker and Myron Laurent — seasoned electricians who were intimately familiar with the tasks covered by the TRIO lesson plans — tackled the work of transforming the curriculum. They broke down each task into its smallest steps to make sure trainees could learn everything they needed to know in VR before trying it in the real world.\n“We asked ourselves: What do you have to do to successfully perform each and every task?” Kelly explains. “What tools do you need? What happens when you do it correctly — what does it look, feel, and sound like? What happens when you do it wrong?”\nJohnnie and Myron had their own considerations when turning the TRIO lesson plans into simulations. With a wealth of experience between them, it became a question of how to teach each skill and how to ensure that learners got what they needed to be successful in the field.\n“One of the things that we struggled with was the fact that there are many ways to do certain tasks and we had to pick and choose what we thought would be the most appropriate,” says Myron.\nWith the tasks broken down into their most minute parts and the training outcomes ascertained, the simulation build teams could start creating the sims. \nBenefits of VR electrical construction training\nElectrical construction training in VR offers very specific benefits, specifically allowing trainees to learn in a safe, consequence-free environment; the ability to practice without classmates’ eyes on you; and eliminating the need for consumables for high-repetition skills.\n“First of all, trainees get a safe environment,” says Myron. “You can have trainees repeat and repeat the modules without having to have a trainer or an employee safeguarding them making sure they weren’t hurting themselves or others or damaging equipment. Fantastic!”\nIn many CTE settings, students can feel highly self-conscious working in front of each other. Electrical construction is a highly male-dominated field, so it can be challenging for anyone not fitting the traditional mold of who and what an electrician is to get into the industry. However, one of the freedoms VR training brings to the classroom is the ability for students to practice until they get a task right, without the pressure of other students watching. Transfr sims give students the freedom to keep practicing on their own, knowing they’re getting consistent guidance and feedback.\n“VR training is very consistently delivered,” says Myron. “We wouldn’t have one instructor putting emphasis on one aspect of a task and a different instructor putting emphasis somewhere else. It’s the same every time!” \nAdditionally, VR electrical construction training eliminates the need for one-time-use (consumable) products. Previously, students would use countless feet of wire and conduit, as well as untold amounts of other consumables. In VR, students can practice and make mistakes without increasing the materials costs for the training company.\n“Construction materials are so expensive now!” says Johnnie. “With VR, all the tools and materials you need are right there: MC, wire, conduit… We’re not wasting anything and to me that’s real important because students are still learning critical skills, just without waste.”\nA bright future for the EC industry\nThe impending electrician shortage is cause for concern, but not alarm, if groups like Trio, Transfr, and other employers, educators, and organizations team up to put the right training in the right hands. Careers in electrical construction can provide job seekers with stable work, income that grows over time, and a career progression that can culminate with training other electricians, running one’s own team, or even starting a company or going into business solo. \n“If you want a job you can go and pick and choose your work and make the money you want to make over time, the electrical trade is it,” says Johnnie. “Just understand that you’re always going to be learning, you know? So if you’re willing to learn, then you’ll be set for life!”"

  "text": "Lab Studies Confirm VR Enhances Knowledge Transfer & Long-Term Retention\nMeasuring the effectiveness of VR skills training is vital to understanding its usefulness in training the future of vital industries. In 2022-23, Transfr conducted two experiments in its Louisville, KY laboratory. Participants were local community members with no prior experience performing the tasks they were trained on. The experiments were designed to assess learners’ ability to transfer knowledge from VR to the real world and retain that knowledge over time.\nLearners were able to transfer most of what they learned in VR to the real world. When given real tools and objects, the average participant was able to accurately perform 75% of the steps in cleaning a paint gun and 66% of the steps in fabricating a flexible fluid line. Even individuals who had never used VR before (28% of participants) were able to complete more than 70% of the paint gun task and more than 60% of the fluid line task. Learners reported the sims were highly usable and produced a strong sense of being present in the virtual training environment.\nIn both experiments, participants were asked to rate their agreement with the statement, “I think I would like to use training simulations like this frequently” on a 1-to-5 scale with 5 indicating strong agreement. Responses were overwhelmingly positive. The average response was 4.0 (SD = 1.2) for the paint gun simulation and 4.2 (SD = .82) for the fluid line simulation. Fully 40% of participants responded with the strongest possible agreement."

  "text": "Augmented Reality Brings Career Exploration Everywhere\nIt’s been widely reported that the pipeline for new trainees and workers in the skilled trades has been declining dramatically for years, which spells disaster for our nation’s infrastructure and people’s daily lives. Absent from these stories is the fact that many of the jobs going unfilled in these fields could provide workers with family-sustaining wages without incurring large amounts of student debt. Potential candidates and school-aged learners often overlook these important roles and their potential for high-paying salaries. There is a general lack of awareness around the great opportunities offered in these fields. It’s also often unclear exactly what training pathways to these jobs look like. \nThe Transfr mission is to train the future of every industry! And before a training journey can start, a job seeker or student needs to know what direction they want to go in. Transfr VR career exploration delivers short introductions to jobs in high-growth industries, allowing students to try out a variety of roles. However, even while more and more organizations are seeing the value in VR career exploration, we also recognized a need to create a non headset-based introductory experience that could be accessed from anywhere, anytime. \nOur solution to helping people from pools of undiscovered talent learn more about amazing opportunities in the skilled trades: Use augmented reality (AR) to share a version of our already-amazing VR career exploration with learners and job seekers across the country. Transfr Vice President, Creative, Alexandra Zaccaria, and Director of Career Exploration and Product-Market Fit, Tom Darling, joined us on Upward, the Transfr podcast, to explain why we built this type of immersive experience and how it can help change lives by getting more people on their personal pathways to career success! \nWhy turn VR career exploration into an AR experience?\nCareer exploration curricula vary widely from state to state and school to school, but one recurring theme is that students and job seekers aren’t given the time and resources they need to really dig into the myriad opportunities available to them. Often schools and students end up favoring more academic pathways to skill-based jobs, particularly in skilled trades. \n“Career exploration right now is primarily limited by student and facilitator time constraints,” says Tom. “You also have students who just don’t see the relevance of career exploration.” \nWhile Transfr’s VR career exploration simulations are very popular, AR deployed through cell phones was seen as a better option to reach more students, more quickly. K12 settings especially saw this as a strong entry point. \n“Schools favored augmented reality because it’s very engaging for the students,” Tom explains. “It’s not just a typical computer-based program; they can use it on their phones.”\nWith a goal of helping more people discover their unique pathways to career success and the right means of doing it identified, the next challenge was translating the VR career exploration content into an AR experience:\n“Our goal for the Transfr AR experience was to give a high-level view of different manufacturing career options to help interested learners better understand where skills training can lead them.” Alexandra says. “The experience showcases the entire classroom-to-career pathway and takes students through training options for five of the sector’s most in-demand jobs in manufacturing. It also includes job numbers, salaries, and employers in four spotlight states: Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, and Illinois.”\nTransfr’s new AR experience gives users across the country a chance to explore roles within the manufacturing industry, no matter where they are (at home, a school, a library, etc.), with equipment they already own — their phone. It’s a fun, accessible Transfr experience for anyone who’s interested in building a better future for themselves and the world. \nDriving interest in manufacturing careers\nManufacturing and the trades are coming back in the US in a big way. People with the right skills (and not necessarily a college degree) will be poised to make good money in high-growth industries. But to get those skills, job seekers need to better understand available career pathways and trajectories for success. These exact paths take on a variety of forms depending on location, but we chose four spotlight states for the AR program based on the resurgence of manufacturing jobs in those specific areas of the country.\n“To build an authentic experience, we partnered with states that are truly focused on growing both their manufacturing industries and local talent.” says Alexandra. \nConnecting the AR experience to the real world is vital when it comes to driving interest in these jobs and getting people on career pathways. That means not just including real job opening numbers and salary projections; the AR experience also had to deliver a compelling and authentic look at what it’s like to actually do these jobs. \n“We chose to highlight the five roles with the most job openings in the Manufacturing sector in the US for the AR experience,” explains Alexandra. “There are thousands of open welder, maintenance person, repair technician, machinist, and assembler positions across the country. Everything you see in the experience is a step-by-step guide taking you from job awareness, through training, and finally connecting you to employers hiring for these key roles in that state.”\nFor employers and educators in these states — or anyplace with a focus on bringing back manufacturing jobs — an AR experience like this could be a powerful tool to drive interest among school-aged youth and job seekers of all kinds. Smartphone use is widespread, which means the pool of potential career explorers out there is vast.\nBuilding a better reality with AR\nSuccessive iterations of almost any product yield incremental improvements. Here at Transfr, we’re passionate about constantly trying to be better today than we were yesterday — that goes for how we treat one another, the relationships we forge, and the products we build. The AR experience we released in October of 2022 was an improvement over the previous year’s version and we’ve already got our sights set on next year’s release.\nFuture iterations of the AR experience will continue to integrate more data on the ever-changing manufacturing landscape. We’re also focused on partnering more closely with employers, workforce boards, educators, and community organizations to better connect the dots for job seekers and get them off their phones and into the workforce. This all ties in closely with Transfr’s mission to help people from pools of undiscovered talent get on their unique career pathways.\n“Our goal is to help simplify the journey from job awareness to education to employment,” Alexandra says. “By streamlining this experience, we hope to help provide hundreds of thousands of people with better options and more opportunities nationwide, enabling them to build the life of their dreams. That’s what we’re all about.”"

  "text": "VR Career Exploration Benefits | Transfr\nSchools and workforce development boards use a range of career exploration activities to help students and job seekers learn about career pathways. Community organizations like Goodwill, the United Way, and the Boys & Girls Club also include these types of activities in their programming. While career education can take many forms, virtual reality (VR) is putting a modern spin on how students and job seekers learn about the opportunities available to them.\nVR career exploration enhances (but doesn’t replace) traditional efforts like job shadowing, industry partner facility tours, and guest speakers. Students can use VR to experience careers first hand, allowing them to better understand job skill expectancies and what working in certain environments feels like. Vitally, they get to do all this in a safe, immersive, and engaging way.\nWhile VR is not a replacement for in-person or on-site events, it does offer students a realistic vantage point to look into a broader variety of occupations in a shorter amount of time. This saves the partner organization considerable time and cost in planning events such as an onsite tour of a facility. With VR, the student can explore more than 20 occupations in the time it would take to do one field trip.\nVR career exploration expands on traditional options\nStudents can’t be what they don’t see and there are an abundance of career options outside of their social and family circles that they might not even be aware of. Finding ways to make career exploration resonate with the next generation can be a challenge but VR can help create experiences that are immersive, fun, and engaging. With certain career environments being unsafe to operate in without proper knowledge, virtual reality allows students to safely explore environments and use equipment they previously did not have access to.\n“The Transfr VR system allows you to work with sometimes dangerous equipment in a safe setting,” says Tom Mudano, CEO of AmSkills USA. “We don’t have to bring in a thousand-dollar piece of equipment or risk people damaging a million-dollar piece of equipment because they can do it virtually.”\nSeeing career environments, learning safety precautions, and using on-the-job equipment allows individuals to understand more completely career expectations. With this level of engagement, students and job seekers have tangible experiences to attach to as they make important decisions for their future. \nSupplement job shadowing with VR career exploration\nWhile students may find guest speakers engaging, it’s becoming more difficult to get students out into real-world workplaces as a natural next step. By bringing careers directly to students in a risk-free environment, virtual reality can help remedy some insurance liabilities. The flexibility of virtual reality also means that students can switch from being an electrician, an automotive technician, a nurse, and a hoist/crane operator in a matter of minutes.\n“I first heard about Transfr at a conference and started doing my research,” says Brian Davis, Director of Career Readiness at Union County Public Schools. “Specifically, we were looking for portability — we wanted to bring the headsets to multiple different school locations, plus use them for special events like summer camps. Transfr was perfect for that.” \nReaching rural students and job seekers comes with additional challenges — transportation being one major hurdle. With the portability of VR, educators have an abundance of careers at their fingertips to take to job fairs, parent/teacher nights, and other community events. The ability to reach urban and rural communities means more students have access to career pathways they may not otherwise have considered.\nVR career exploration augments instructor efforts\nNot all students are aware of the vast range of career choices that offer life-sustaining wages without the debt of a four-year college degree. VR can lead to more conversation pathways between students and mentors, counselors, or parents about careers they may not have considered — as well as careers they’ve considered and decided not to pursue! This can help ensure that more options are considered before committing to a multi-year or life-long decision.\nA case study done over four weeks with West AlabamaWorks saw 1,100 students explore new career paths, which led to an 18% increase in CTE enrollment. Informed students make better decisions and there are few decisions more important in a student’s life at that time than what they’re going to do post-graduation. \n“This program is creating five-star recruits: Teachers are empowered and engaged, students are better qualified and ready for success on day one,” says Donny Jones, COO of West AlabamaWorks. “Students with a higher academic achievement rate are being attracted to industry — creating leaders of the future — and more kids are staying in the community because of local, well-paying jobs”.\nFor some students, a four-year college pathway is the easiest decision they will make, but for others, VR helps students break out of the college-only paradigm by allowing them to see themselves performing at a high level in careers that aren’t top of mind.\nBecause VR is relevant, new, and cool, students naturally gravitate towards it. Meeting students where their interests are is a strategy that educators have been using for decades. Ironically, the message being delivered is the real star as students walk away from VR experiences raving about how cool a potential job interest is instead of how cool virtual reality is.\nOpen doors for students and job seekers with VR career exploration\nVirtual reality offers a wide array of engaging experiences to help students answer one of life’s greatest questions: What to do with one’s life. Putting more career options onto a student’s radar means they’re more able to make an informed decision and increase the likelihood of success post-graduation. \nFiguring out one’s career used to require traveling to different locations for students, among other more time-consuming efforts. Meanwhile, VR career exploration brings experiences directly to students while lowering safety risks and increasing engagement. Now students can go beyond just hearing about career opportunities; they can understand at a deeper level what a career actually is.\n“VR career exploration with Transfr gives students a chance to really test out new jobs and do something hands-on,” says Elizabeth Higginbotham, Career Development Coordinator at Union County Public Schools. “The experience can encourage kids to take their interest a step further. It creates excitement in learning.”"
